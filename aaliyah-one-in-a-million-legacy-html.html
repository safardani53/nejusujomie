Aaliyah then began working with Timbaland for her second album titled One In A Million, which peaked at No.2 on the R&B chart and sold over 2 million units in just the first year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Over the years, her song with the same title as the album has been sampled by some of the most successful artists today, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and many more. Here’s a look at four artists who&nbsp;sampled Aaliyah’s ‘One In A Million’ track.</p><h2>Normani ‘Wild Side’</h2><p>Normani’s song ‘Wild Side’ featuring Cardi B, is one of the most recent songs that has sampled Aaliyah’s hit song. When talking on the Zach Sang Show, <a href=# rel=follow>Normani</a> revealed Aaliyah was one of her favorite artists of all time.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She was touched by her music for the first time during Aaliyah's peak years and said the 1990s and 2000s were the best eras of music. Normani’s ‘Wild Side’ took much inspiration from ‘One In A Million,’ and the singer shared what she thought of her song and its relation to the late Princess of R&B. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>I felt like the record was strong enough to be able to feel nostalgic but also to feel like I have ownership over it. Like it’s in there and it’s like, ‘Okay! It makes me feel the same thing One In A Million made me feel but it’s original’. I felt like it was original enough so I didn’t stress over it.</p><h2>Ariana Grande ‘West Side’</h2><p><a href=# rel=follow>Ariana Grande</a>’s 2020 song ‘West Side’ is another song that sampled&nbsp;'One In A&nbsp;Million' for its beat.</p><p>Grande penned the song with her friend and frequent co-writer, Victoria Monet, and it’s believed&nbsp;that it is based on her relationship with Dalton Gomez.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Tink ‘Million’</h2><p>Tink reworked ‘One In A Million’ in her 2015 song ‘Million’ with Timbaland supporting her. The producer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed his reason</a> for letting Tink flip Aaliyah’s song during&nbsp;2015’s The Fader Fort. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>I don’t touch Baby Girl’s records — you know that’s Aaliyah. I was riding home one day, asleep, she spoke to me in my sleep, and said [Tink’s] the one.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Jay-Z ‘A Million And One Question’</h2><p>In Jay-Z’s 2001 song ‘A Million and One Question,’ DJ Premier, who produced the track, sampled Aaliyah’s song. Though Aaliyah and Jay Z never collaborated, the rapper remixed Aaliyah’s ‘Miss You,’ where he rapped about her absence.</p><p>Jay-Z also paid homage to many other artists in the song, including Big L, Freaky Tah, Tupac, and Notorious BIG.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmRoba6rcdmpqedXZ67bq2MpqClpJmku264xKCYnLFencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./george-clooneys-ex-girlfriends-who-let-him-get-away.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>George Clooney's Ex-Girlfriends: Who Let Him Get Away?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./game-of-thrones-inspired-cocktails.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Game of Thrones' Inspired Cocktails Recipes and Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
