The recent revelation of Jane's alcoholism has also added another layer of complexity to the Carters. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why is Aaron on Marriage Boot Camp with his mom?</a> We're breaking down the history of issues, which began on tour buses when Aaron was just a kid.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Aaron Carter on Marriage Boot Camp?</h2><p>While some other seasons of the show have revolved around romantically involved couples who aren't always getting along, this season will focus on familial issues.

Angel and Nick recently got restraining orders against Aaron, because he allegedly had thoughts of killing children, and the two have young kids.</p><p>In order to fully understand Aaron's issues with Jane, we have to go back to early in his career, to the year 2003.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The public first got wind of Aaron's problems with his mom when he accused her of stealing $100,000 from his bank account in 2003, when he was just 16 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2004, Jane and her husband, Bob Carter, split, and she was later arrested for beating Bob's soon-to-be-wife, Ginger Elrod.&nbsp;</p><p>In the years following, Nick (who is a singer in The Backstreet Boys) and Aaron dealt with public issues, including arrests and substance abuse. Both Nick and Aaron went on to say that the environment in their home growing up contributed to their behavior, with Nick even claiming that he had his first sip of alcohol at the age of 2, in the bar that his family owned.</p><p>Both Nick and Aaron have also discussed the fact that they were put under a lot of pressure to be successful in their singing careers, because their income was keeping the family afloat (there were five total Carter siblings).</p><p>Nick detailed his addiction issues in his 2013 memoir Facing the Music And Living To Talk About It, while Aaron himself entered a rehab program in 2011. Their sister, Leslie, passed away from a drug overdose in 2012 too.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Jane herself is battling alcoholism, which she opened up about on a recent episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Doctors.</a> Aaron had previously realized that he needed help after appearing on the show, which is why he encouraged his mom to appear on it.
