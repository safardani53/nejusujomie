Scientifically it doesn’t make sense to do this," she said.</p><p>This is because the enzyme that's used to dissolve <a href=#>filler</a> causes swelling to the tissues and inflamation.</p><p>These are not ideal conditions to be injecting filler in, as they distort the natural anatomy of the lip compartment, the expert warned.</p><p>"The effects of the dissolving enzyme also continue for 72 hours after injection (and possibly longer) and there is no certainty of how far it will spread so the outcomes are not predictable.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>"Surgical tape is definitely not going to stop this. There is no way of knowing how these lips will look in a few weeks time," Dr Panch added.</p><p>Several videos have now gone viral on <a href=#>social media</a> platforms like <a href=#>TikTok</a>, of other people getting the treatments.</p><p>Celebs who've had the treatments have also shared their results online, which Dr Panch said might encourage others to opt for the tweakment.</p><p>Dr Panch said it's important to be aware of the risks of this procedure if it's something you're thinking of getting.</p><p>"It’s important to note that the dissolving enzyme will not only dissolve filler but can also destroy your natural hyaluronic acid, which is obviously not desirable as it is a key molecule involved in skin moisture.</p><p>"In addition to this, the effects of using tape to hold this filler in place after overfilling the compartment is completely futile, not to mention completely unhygienic and so significantly increases your risk of developing an infection.</p><p>"With such large volumes of filler being injected and disrupting the delicate lip architecture, it is inevitable that this filler will migrate, creating a “duck like” appearance," she said.</p><p>She added that she would not be offering this procedure in any form to her patients.</p><p>"I&nbsp;am certain no reputable medical practitioner will be offering this treatment either," the expert said.</p><h2>HAD OUR FILL</h2><p><a href=#>The Sun’s Had Our Fill campaign</a>&nbsp;has been calling for tighter regulation of the £2.75billion fillers industry since 2020.</p><p>Clinics and salons have already been banned from giving <a href=#>Botox</a> and lip fillers to under-18s unless they are for GP-approved medical reasons.</p><p>However, Dr Panch said that there is still a lack of regulation when it comes to products used in fillers.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"The market is flooded with unsafe, cheap and ineffective products which are sold to the consumer at a considerably cheaper price point than those regulated premium products used in reputable medical clinics."</p><p>She added that lip procedures should only ever be carried out by regulated medical professionals who understand anatomy and are able to manage any complication that may arise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzfZZqbnJrYWSupr%2FToZytoZOoeqW7wq2mq2WSqsG1sdGfo7JlnJ69tHnKmquinV2lv6qvxGajmq2imrtus86om6CdomQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-dela-cruz-19890323-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Dela Cruz (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./plus-size-shein-haul-green-dress-perfect-christmas-parties.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I'm a size 20 &amp;amp; tried on Shein plus size dresses - one's perfect for Christmas parties but others we</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
