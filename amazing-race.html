Language barriers.<br><strong>What excites you most about traveling?</strong> It makes you smarter, more cultured and getting to experience new places, people, food, etc.<br><strong>Biggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together:</strong> I would like us to be able to communicate what’s best for each other as an “us.” Sometimes we lose focus on what’s best, to simply be right individually.<br><strong>Pet peeve about your teammate: </strong>Many times she loses perspective, forgets the big picture and becomes obsessed with being right, rather than solving the problem. And she thinks being the loudest makes her right.<br><strong>What country and place would you most like to visit and why?</strong> Anywhere that I wouldn’t normally think to go or want to go. Maybe see the pyramids, drop into a rainforest or secluded island.<br><strong>What do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)? </strong>Learn how to work together. When we aren’t dating everything is amazing, but as soon as we commit and decisions have to be made together, TROUBLE!</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> Marie “Reebs” Mazzocchi<br><strong>Age:</strong> 29<br><strong>Hometown:</strong> Morristown, N.J.<br><strong>Connection to your teammate</strong>: Exes<br><strong>Current occupation: </strong>Fitness Trainer/Gym Owner<br><strong>Describe what you do: </strong>Kickboxing instructor/personal trainer 3 words to describe you: Impulsive, energetic and impatient.<br><strong>Favorite hobbies:</strong> Going to the gym, watching and playing sports and drawing.<br><strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? </strong>There isn't one specific thing that stands out to me. I like to go after things where the odds are stacked against you. Victory is a lot sweeter when the challenge is greater.<br><strong>What famous person reminds you of yourself? </strong>Kristin Cavallari - (is she even still famous?) she doesn’t care what anyone thinks, does what she wants when she wants.<br><strong>What famous person reminds you of your teammate? </strong>Ryan Lochte, because he's in love with himself.<br><strong>What scares you most about traveling? </strong>Being helpless in an environment where I don’t speak the language/cleanliness - I’m a total germaphobe.<br><strong>What excites you most about traveling? </strong>Seeing different places and cultures. I’ve never been outside the U.S.<br><strong>Biggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: </strong>Neither one of us actually listens to one another - we both just yell at the same time trying to be right and walk away…nothing ever gets resolved.<br><strong>Pet peeve about your teammate:</strong> He always has to be right, even when he knows he’s wrong. He justifies anything and creates an argument out of anything and everything.<br><strong>What country and place would you most like to visit and why? </strong>A rainforest and/or any country or place with exotic animals!<br><strong>What do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks?): </strong>We both love competition. For us this race is more about winning than money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa3RmqSorZ6pva3B0meaqKVfqLWww9JomKaZqp67qKvRmpqeZ5OWwLV7kWprcGxpZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-hanks-slams-hideously-offensive-blackface-costume-at-school.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Hanks Slams &amp;quot;Hideously Offensive&amp;quot; Blackface Costume Guy at School Fundraiser</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./southern-charm-kathryn-dennis-ex-joe-abruzzo-sues-bravo-penis-discussion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Southern Charms Kathryn Dennis ex sues Bravo for shows stars talking about his Ken doll</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
