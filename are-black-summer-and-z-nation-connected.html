Not because it's a prequel to the former Syfy series <a href=#>Z Nation</a> necessarily, but mostly because it presents a new kind of post-apocalyptic world of zombies and humans who still haven't all figured out that the head shot is key. Most fans might not even know the two are related, but those who watched Z Nation for its entire five-season run picked up on some similarities between the two series.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>And now that there have been two full seasons of Black Summer, fans are curious about how the two shows are connected. Even though one series is from a television network and the other is on a streaming platform, they do share a distinct link that is becoming harder to ignore. And while that connection may or may not play into the future of Black Summer, it's still worth exploring.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How are 'Black Summer' and 'Z Nation' connected?</h2><p>The most important thing linking the two shows together is the fact that Black Summer is a prequel series to Z Nation. In the latter, a virus outbreak called NZ1 caused by a scientist spreads across the world at an alarming rate, taking over people and turning them into aggressive, flesh-eating zombies even before it becomes airborne.</p><p>In Black Summer, viewers see the onset of the same virus making its way through a neighborhood before it, too, spreads like wildfire.</p><p>While Z Nation takes place a few years after the outbreak occurs and in a new world, Black Summer starts off at the very beginning, thus making it a prequel.</p><p>But that's where most of the similarities end. It's possible that there will be more mentions of the science behind the virus in future seasons of Black Summer, further linking it to Z Nation and the mythos behind the cause. But Black Summer was always meant to be more of a standalone prequel.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I LOVED "Black Summer" season 2! I couldn't stop watching until it was over. I'm ready for more! It's crazy to me that it's a prequel to "Z Nation" because they are shot so differently. Z Nation was much more campy to me.

In Z Nation, a vaccine is tested on prison inmates and it works on one of them, though the inmate's body decomposes while he is alive, even if he never truly changes into a zombie.</p><p>So far, there hasn't been any inklings of a cure for the virus in Black Summer, but some fans think the connection between the two shows might become clearer in the future.
