Each video series tells a different story, often based on Ashley’s real-life experiences. For example, the series’ Yandere High School’ follows four friends in their first year at ‘Minecraft High School.’</p><p>Another ‘Ashleyosity’ episodic video series is based on ‘Roblox.’ ‘Roblox Fairies & Mermaids Winx High!’ and ‘Roblox Royale High!’ are two of them. The majority of the episodes in the life simulation game series have been viewed millions of times.</p><p>Furthermore, ‘Yandere High School | FIRST DAY! [Minecraft Roleplay | Ep. 1]’ is the first ‘Ashleyosity’ video to have surpassed one million views. Other popular videos on the channel include ‘Yandere High School | MY FIRST KISS.’ ‘My Kid Is Rich?? | Roblox Bloxburg,’ ‘I AM A PRINCESS?? / Roblox Roleplay | Roblox Royale High | Ep. 5’, ‘Adopting Triplets?!? | Roblox Fairies And Mermaids Winx High School,’ and many more.</p><p>On September 1, 2017, Ashley launched her second gaming-related channel, ‘Ashleyosity – Sims.’ The channel, formerly known as ‘SimsWithAsh,’ is dedicated to the fourth installment of the life simulation video game series ‘The Sims.’ The channel features ‘The Sims 4 Gameplay,’ ‘The Sims 4 Builds,’ and other ‘The Sims’ content. Ashley has been a devoted ‘The Sims’ player since 2012 when her mother purchased the first ‘The Sims’ game for her.</p><p>She was captivated by the game and spent countless hours immersed in it. Ashley now has the entire ‘The Sims’ (including spin-offs) game collection, including single expansions, “goodies,” and game packs for both the console and handheld versions. Several ‘The Sims’ video series are featured on the channel, including ‘The Sims 4 Vampires,’ ‘The Sims 4 CrashLife,’ ‘The Sims 4 Sterling Legacy,’ and ‘The Sims 4 Cats & Dogs.’</p><h2>More On Career</h2><p>Ashley’s next YouTube project was a joint channel with her husband, fellow YouTube gamer Christopher Foltz, also known as “Chrisandthemike.” The channel, titled ‘Ashley and Chris,’ was launched in October 2016 and is the couple’s only non-gaming social media page. It is primarily a vlog channel where Ashley and Chris share their private lives with their viewers. The channel, however, is similar to Ashley’s first channel.</p><p>The vlogs on the channel are published in the form of episodes and under the name ‘CrashLife,’ which comes from the term “Crash Nation,” which refers to the pair’s fan base. As a result, the name ‘Crash’ represents both of their names (Chris + Ashley = Crash).</p><p>Ashley works with Chris on other online gaming ventures in addition to creating content for her gaming-related channels. She frequently appears on Chris’s channel, ‘Chrisandthemike,’ which is dedicated to the ‘Roblox’ game ‘Jailbreak.’ They also make videos for ‘Crash Nation.’</p><p>After Chris disabled two of his collaborative channels, Chris and Ashley, along with their fellow gamers Sean (aka Garlian) and Carlo, moved in for the first time. Chris filmed several series of ‘Minecraft Family’ roleplays and live streams of various games on ‘Mixer’ with Ashley and Carlo. The crew split up a few months later, and Chris and Ashley started their own ‘YouTube channel.</p><h2>Ashleyosity Husband, Marriage</h2><p><strong>Ashley</strong> is a married lady. In June 2018, she married YouTuber Christopher Foltz. Chris previously married Lasata. Their marriage was complicated and troubled shortly after they moved in with their ‘Minecraft’ family. Chris’s marriage ended in early 2016.</p><p>Soon after, he began dating Ashley while they were both working on their ‘YouTube ventures. Chris proposed to Ashley during a vacation in the summer of 2018. Their shared interest in gaming is an excellent example of how they were made for each other.</p><p>However, their Instagram posts show that not only do they share a mutual interest, but they also accept each other’s flaws, indicating that this lovely couple is definitely growing old together. There’s something intriguing about their relationship! That is, Ashley’s birthday is July 1st, Chris’s birthday is July 2nd, and their anniversary is July 3rd! What a fun and lucky couple they are.</p><h2>Ashleyosity Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Ashley</strong> undoubtedly makes a good living from her profession. Her YouTube channel could earn her a lot of money. She does, however, have a net worth of around $419K as of November 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYrKCcmsawv8itsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./honey-boo-boos-anna-cardwell-talks-daughters-thumb-removal-w451540.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Honey Boo Boo's Anna Cardwell Talks Daughter's Thumb Removal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thom-bierdz.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Thom Bierdz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
