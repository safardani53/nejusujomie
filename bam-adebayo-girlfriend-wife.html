He is a very private person, and he has not shared any glimpses of his dating life in public.</p><p>However, rumors were claiming that Adebayo had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">secretly</a> tied the knot; but these speculations were later proven to be baseless and fake. There is not a single piece of evidence supporting any claims of his marriage.</p><p>Even a thorough examination of his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> profile reveals no pictures indicating that he is in a relationship. The majority of the content on his feed is related to his career, demonstrating his current focus on his NBA journey.</p><p>Adebayo is currently committed to developing his basketball skills and is directing all his attention toward becoming an NBA star.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bam Adebayo’s dating history</h2><p>Similar to Adebayo’s current dating status, there is no recorded history of him being in a public <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">relationship</a>. He has also not been linked to any well-known personality to this date.</p><p>However, in 2021, the basketball player was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spotted</a> watching a game with three girls who appeared to be quite comfortable around him. Despite them enjoying each other’s company, fans found a way to playfully tease him and his companions.</p><p>One person tweeted, “Shiiit, no wonder he’s been playing like a man possessed…ol girl is a slump buster that’ll last a career right there.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shiiit, no wonder he’s been playing like a man possessed..ol girl is a slump buster that’ll last a career right there. <a href=#>https://t.co/WrQOhVkqXp</a></p>— Dr. Danny Sanders (@dannysanders80) <a href=# rel=noopener>May 6, 2021</a></figure><p>Similarly, another said, “Man ok, on the surface this is funny AF! Maybe I’m getting soft in my old age, but damn I feel bad for that poor girl! Everyone is roasting him but primarily at her expense! I’d be so pissed if that was my sister or daughter getting dragged through the mud to trust him.”</p><p>Amid these comments, some individuals stepped forward to defend the girls and criticize those who engaged in making fun of people’s appearances. Despite the widespread online discussions about Adebayo being seen with girls, he chose to remain silent on the situation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Bam Adebayo’s family background</h2><p>Adebayo was born in Newark, New Jersey, to a Nigerian Yoruba father, John Adebayo, and an African-American mother, Marilyn Blout.</p><p>As a child, his mother gave him the nickname Bam Bam after a memorable incident at the age of one when he flipped over a coffee table while watching The Flintstones, resembling the show’s character Bamm-Bamm Rubble.</p><p>After his parents’ separation, his mother <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">raised</a> him in Newark. Later, when he turned seven, the NBA player moved with his mother to North Carolina, marking a significant chapter in his life. Unfortunately, this relocation resulted in limited interactions with his father.</p><p>The physical distance and lack of connection with his father during his formative years led Adebayo to harbor resentment toward his last name and Nigerian heritage.</p><p>Later, when Adebayo reached the age of 16, he actively embarked on a journey to learn more about his Nigerian background. Over time, he has not only reconciled with his heritage but has actively chosen to celebrate and incorporate it into his identity.</p><p>However, tragically, the basketball player’s father <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">passed</a> away in 2020 while peacefully residing in Nigeria. Now, he is left with the love and support of his mother alone.</p><p>Adebayo has openly shared numerous special moments with his mother on his Instagram, showcasing the close bond and affection they share. On February 20, 2020, he shared a heartfelt picture where he stood beside his mother, who was proudly holding his trophy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Alongside the post, he captioned, “The bond between mother and son is a special one. It remains unchanged by time or distance. It is the purest love—unconditional and true. It’s understanding of any situation and forgiving of any mistake.”</p><p>Similarly, on December 7, 2021, the NBA player <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> a delightful picture featuring him and his mother relaxing on a boat. Accompanying the post was a touching caption, “Sons may turn into men, and grow out of their toys, but in the hearts of their mothers, they are still little boys.”</p><p>He continued, “Happy Birthday to the woman that made me… me! You’re still the greatest I’ve ever seen do this sh*t called life.”</p><p>Upon seeing the post, numerous fans and followers flooded the comments section with expressions of admiration for the heartwarming bond between the NBA player and his mother.</p><p>One person expressed, “So cute!!!! As a mommy, I melt seeing the way you treat her. As a daughter, I miss more than everything having these moments with my amazing mommy!’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brief on Bam Adebayo’s career</h2><p>Adebayo displayed a keen interest in basketball from an early age.
