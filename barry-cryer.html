Barry Cryer</b><span>‘s </span><b>net worth</b><span> was believed to be between</span><b> $1 million – $5 million</b><span>. His excellent profession as a comedian is obviously his primary source of money.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Career</h2><p>Cryer appeared in Expresso Bongo (1957) with Susan Hampshire, Millicent Martin, and Paul Scofield, and sang the song “The Purple People Eater,” which is better known in Sheb Wooley’s rendition. Wooley’s version was never published in Scandinavia due to contractual problems, but Cryer’s was and hit number one in Finland.&nbsp;Cryer’s earliest writing credits were four skits co-written with Douglas Camfield for The Jimmy Logan Show. Cryer worked as a head writer for Danny La Rue’s London nightclub when he was discovered by David Frost.</p><p>This led to Cryer’s writing involvement on the variety program A Degree of Frost, which led to Cryer joining the writing team for The Frost Report, which also featured John Cleese, Graham Chapman, and Marty Feldman, from 1966 to 1967.&nbsp;Frost hired Cryer on a number of future episodes, cementing Cryer’s reputation as a prominent writer in the 1970s. Cryer may be seen pouring wine in the original performance of the Four Yorkshiremen comedy on At Last the 1948 Show, which aired in 1967.&nbsp;Cryer always liked to write in collaboration so that if he ran out of ideas, no one would be left to give the content. During the 1970s, his frequent collaborator was John Junkin, and with Junkin playing Eric Morecambe and Cryer playing Ernie Wise, the two wrote sections of The Morecambe and Wise Show for the BBC (the 1972 and 1976 Christmas programs) when regular writer Eddie Braben was unavailable.</p><p>Cryer continued to love performing, including in the BBC radio series Hello, Cheeky! with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Junkin, in which the three performers bounced jokes off each other. He also voiced the judge in the 1975 animated comedy-musical Dick Deadeye, or Duty Done, and participated in the comedic television series The Steam Video Company.&nbsp;He presented the ITV comic panel game Jokers Wild (1969–74), appeared in All You Need Is Cash, a 1978 spoof documentary about the Beatles parody band The Rutles, and appeared as a police inspector in Kenny Everett’s 1984 horror spoof Bloodbath at the House of Death.</p><h2>Barry Cryer Wife & Marriage</h2><p><b>Who is Barry Cryer’s wife?</b><span>&nbsp; Cryer married Theresa, sometimes known as Terry, in 1962. They were the parents of four children, three boys, and a girl. They also have seven grandkids and one great-grandchild as of 2017.</span></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZmqqirnqkvtieqWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./danielle-cormack.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Danielle Cormack net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cory-monteith-lea-michele-relationship-timeline-photos-dating-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>[PICS] Cory Monteith &amp;amp; Lea Micheles Relationship Timeline Dating History Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
