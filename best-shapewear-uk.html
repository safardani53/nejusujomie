The best shapewear enhances your figure, making you feel confident, sexy and ready to take on anything, without being too restrictive or uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>We're not just talking high-waisted Spandex pants – there is shapewear for all kinds of needs. Whether that's lifting your butt, pulling in your waist or simply smoothing your tummy rolls.</p><p>Don't worry, shapewear has come a long way since its inception. It's now all about being really comfortable and feeling as though you aren't actually wearing any at all.</p><p>Thanks to names like Kim Kardashian's label Skims and Lizzo's brand Yitty being widely available in the UK, you can now get shapewear that actually looks pretty good too. You might even want to wear some pieces as actual evening attire (we're looking at you, Skims Soft Lounge Ribbed Slip Dress)</p><p>To help you navigate this now-wonderful, empowering space, we've found the best shapewear to shop online now. From Spanx to Skims and Heist, we've got it all.</p><h2>What is shapewear?</h2><p>Shapewear is literally what it says in the name: garments that you wear underneath your clothes to shape and flatter your body.</p><p>Senior stylist at Thread, Millie Rich describes shapewear as "an undergarment that helps smooth and sculpt your figure to accentuate your natural curves."</p><h2>Best shapewear at a glance</h2><h2>SPANX Thinstincts 2.0 Cami</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_1218-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Thinstincts-2.0-Cami.jpeg></p><ul><li><strong>SPANX Thinstincts 2.0 Cami, £59from Luxury Legs - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, replaces need for bra, breathable, thong, sweat-wicking, lightweight, adjustable straps</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only available in black and beige</p><p><strong>Ratings:</strong> 5/5</p><p>Shaping camis work miracles on the tummy, waistline and bust, and this one fit like a glove. It's ever so slightly see-through so you're better wearing it underneath a T-Shirt or dress than alone. Thanks to the adjustable straps, you can probably get away with wearing this with no bra. The straps are convertible too, so you could wear this vest with a racer-back dress or a regular one. The bust is non-compression so this vest isn't targeting your boobs, instead it focusses on your tummy and sides. There's an engineered shaping panel to control your lower stomach and hip area. We can confirm that it really does flatten the tummy, but without making you feel restricted.&nbsp;</p><h2>SPANX Suit Your Fancy Strapless Cupped Panty Bodysuit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Suit-Your-Fancy-Cupped-Panty-Bodysuit_Front.jpeg><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_1223.png></p><ul><li><strong>SPANX Suit Your Fancy Strapless Cupped Panty Bodysuit, £132.00 from Luxury Legs - </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>buy here</strong></a></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, replaces need for bra, additional straps mean you can wear it 5 ways, can go strapless, breathable, silicone strip keeps legs section in place, sweat-wicking, lightweight, adjustable straps, poppers&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only available in black and beige</p><p><strong>Ratings:</strong> 5/5</p><p>If the wireless Spanx bodysuit didn't provide enough chest support, you'll prefer this cupped one. It sculpts and smooths over the tummy and hips area while supporting and lifting your boobs. The fit is based on your regular UK dress size, and the adjustable straps and back closure means you can give yourself a custom fit. And, it comes with an extra set of clear straps and a hook as well as the existing matching ones, so you can wear the straps five ways: traditional, racerback, criss-cross, halter, and strapless.&nbsp;</p><p>The silicone strip on the inside of the back of the leg/bum area means no VPL or bunching up, either.</p><p>This is one of the most effective pieces of shapewear we've tried because it is super flattering all over and also not restrictive or too thick.&nbsp;</p><h2>SPANX Cotton Control Thong</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cotton-Control-Thong_Back.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_1220.png><ul><li><strong>SPANX Cotton Control Thong, £24 from John Lewis - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, breathable, double layer waistband smooths tummy, doesn't dig, stretchy, breathable cotton, lightweight</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ratings:</strong> 5/5</p><p>Sometimes you want your thong to do a little more than just act as underwear, but you don't always want to be wearing compression pants.

They promise to lift, support and control your shape while smoothing the silhouette and making you look slimmer, and we can confirm that this is exactly what they do.&nbsp;</p><p>We were a little concerned to begin with, as the shorts appeared to be far too small for us we tried to wiggle into them.&nbsp; However, you'd be amazed at how nicely they fit once you do get them on. Plus, the tight fit is a key component to the slimming effect that you're after.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While they might be snug, they don't cause any unflattering fat bulges or overhang.</p><p>The shorts finish just a couple of inches above the knee and the waistband is so high that it reaches just below your bra band. Not only did we feel more supported and sucked in, but our curves were enhanced and we felt slimmer all over.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike a lot of shapewear, we didn't find these shorts to be uncomfortable at all.</p><p>In fact, we wouldn't be tempted to whip them off in the bathroom halfway through an evening out like we often do with a lot of other shapewear.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing we love the most about these shorts though, is the clear clingy band of silicone around the waistband.</p><p>This addition ensures that the waistband stays in place and doesn't drop or bunch up under your clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>We think these would work best under a maxi dress (we've worn them under our favourite silk slip dress because they're seamless), but they could work under a mini dress too as long as the colour is a close enough match.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Everybody Shape Enhancing Seamless Bodysuit&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/V9VBN_SQ1_0000000108_BEIGE_MDf.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0537.png><ul><li><strong>Everybody Shape Enhancing Seamless Bodysuit in Beige, £30 from Very -<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>Comfortable, easy to get on, can replace the need for a bra, adjustable straps, poppers, available in 4 different sizes</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Slight VPL&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>Much like the brand's shorts from the Everybody range, the bodysuit has become a real staple in our wardrobe. This one is really easy to get in to, but has just as much sculpting power on the stomach area.</p><p>It's ideal for flattening your tummy area and supporting your boobs under a T-Shirt or dress. We wore ours underneath a very fitted black maxi dress and found that you could only very slightly see the knicker line, but it would be undetectable under something slightly looser. The low scoop neck means you can wear it underneath garments with a variety of necklines, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Our tester has an average-sized chest and found they were able to go braless with this bodysuit. However, if you've been blessed with a larger chest you may want to tighten up the adjustable shoulder straps and double up with a supportive bra.&nbsp;</p><p>The poppers between the leg space make it easy to go to the loo without needing to remove the shapewear and your clothes first, too.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Everybody Shape Enhancing Seamless Short Mid-Thigh Bodysuit&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Everybody-Shape-Enhancing-Seamless-Short-Mid-Thigh-Bodysuit.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0538.png><ul><li><strong>Everybody Shape Enhancing Seamless Short Mid Thigh Bodysuit in Mink, £22 from Very - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>Adjustable straps, comfortable, can replace the need for a bra, affordable, comfortable, seamless</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Have to remove in order to go to the toilet, hard to get on</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>If you're after shapewear that covered everything but your arms and calves, then look no further. It's as if the regular bodysuit and shorts from this brand were joined up as one garment. But, this has to be our favourite of the entire collection.</p><p>The thick-but-lightweight fabric feels luxurious and gives you the same smooth, sculpting effect that you'd get from any of the more expensive shapewear brands.&nbsp;We didn't feel restricted, either.</p><p>The biggest difference we noticed with this bodysuit was that it made our waist look smaller and had a more seamless overall slimming effect because there were no gaps in our underwear.&nbsp;</p><p>It is definitely a little hard to get on, but like the shorts from this range, it's comfortable once you're wearing it. We'll continue to wear ours under our favourite long-sleeved maxi dress, but you could probably wear yours with a mini dress too.&nbsp;</p><p>The only annoying thing is, you'd need to remove the entire piece of shapewear and your outfit in order to go to the loo.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=m0>Pour Moi Definitions Shapewear Tummy Control Strapless Body</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/275696_20220215164400.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0540.png><ul><li><strong>Pour Moi Definitions Shapewear Tummy Control Strapless Body in Caramel, £27.60 from Pour Moi - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Underwired, adjustable and removable straps, smoothing cups, hook fastening back, poppers, affordable, sizes based on cup and band size for perfect fit</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not based on dress size, so can be hard to find the right fit, slight VPL&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5&nbsp;</p><p>If you want a piece of shapewear that you can wear with almost any dress in your wardrobe — strapless or otherwise — you'll be a fun of this one from Pour Moi.</p><p>Its main feature is the fact that you can adjust or totally remove the straps. And, if you're wearing a racerback, you could cross over the straps to ensure they're covered.&nbsp;</p><p>This bodysuit definitely made us feel more sucked in than usual and smoothed over bumpy areas. However, while the seams do have a contouring effect, they will show through your clothes. So, in our opinion, this bodysuit would work best under a slightly looser dress.</p><p>It is the best choice for ladies with fuller busts though since you're able to tailor it to your exact cup and band size and the built-in bra is underwired for extra support.</p><p>And, it has an adjustable hook and eye back fastening so you can loosen the bodysuit over the course of the day if it's too tight. Clever, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Let's not forget to mention the handy popper fastenings underneath, either.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=m0>Pour Moi Hourglass Firm Control High Waist Short&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/314227_20230412163200.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0542.jpg><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>High-waisted (but not ultra high-waisted), firm hold, seamless, short enough to wear a mini dress&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;Contoured panels sometimes visible through clothes&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p><p>For a simple pair of shaping shorts that stop at the smallest part of your waist, look to Pour Moi.</p><p>While a super-high waist is normally more flattering, we found the lower waistline on this pair to be a bit of a relief. They were still flattering and the hold is really firm, but we enjoyed the reduced intensity of a regular high waist compared to a waist that stops below the bra.&nbsp;</p><p>These shorts are pretty much seamless and can be worn under most things, but the contoured panels were slightly visible when we worse them underneath a simple ribbed bodycon dress.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll continue to wear these to prevent chafing and enhance our figure without discomfort, as they feel quite breathable and are still loose enough to wear all day.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=m0>Pour Moi Definitions Shaping Control Brief&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/118872_20210202094300.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0543.jpg><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>High-waisted, soft edges don't dig, tummy control, smoothing, lightweight and breathable&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;Soft edges roll slightly</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>At first glance, we&nbsp; didn't think these lightweight, thin and silky knickers would do much. However, when we looked closer, we realised that the fabric is thicker and bonded around the tummy area for zonal control.</p><p>The fabric in the back is stretchy and smooth so that it is comfortable and doesn't create a VPL. If your main aim is smoothing and slimming your tummy and hips, Pour Moi's knickers are all you need.&nbsp;</p><p>These knickers are easier to get into than a pair of sculpting shorts, but they're still just as supportive on the tummy.</p><p>Our only gripe would be the soft edges which, although they create a seamless effect and don't dig into the skin, can roll down and bunch up a little bit.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=m0>Yitty Nearly Naked Shaping Thong Bodysuit&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BU2251651-3437-1_577x866.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0544.jpg><ul><li><strong>Yitty Nearly Naked Shaping Thong Bodysuit in Moody Bitch Taupe, £84.95 (£25.48 for members) from Fabletics - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, flattering, stretchy, supportive on the bust, thong (no VPL), mo-roll waistband, available in a variety of colours, wide size range (from XS to 5X)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;None</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>We now have the Yitty Nearly Naked Shaping Thong Bodysuit in black and taupe, and we'd buy it in every single colour if we could (we've got our eyes on shades Bossed Up Brown and Tempo Lavender right now).</p><p>These bodysuits are incredibly flattering, but they really don't feel or look like shapewear. You could just as easily wear them under a dress to support your tummy as you could wear them with a pair of jeans and a blazer and some hoop earrings to dinner.&nbsp;</p><p>These bodysuits really hug your curves and are completely and utterly seamless (thanks to the 4-way stretch fabric). We'd feel comfortable wearing these in the summer too, since the fabric is so breathable and lightweight.&nbsp;</p><p>With an average chest size, we find the Yitty bodysuit to be a great alternative to a bra and knickers and we wear ours underneath plain T-Shirts and smart shirts all the time.</p><p>The clever 'anti-uniboob' technology ensures that your boobs stay separate and supported, and since the bodysuits are available in up to size 5X (a UK dress size 34), ladies with larger chests may feel comfortable enough to go braless too.&nbsp;</p><p>Lizzo and her design team thought through every single detail, ensuring that this bodysuit is as practical (it's moisture-wicking and has bathroom-friendly popper closures) as it is sustainable (it's made with recycled fabric); we're seriously impressed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=m0>Yitty Nearly Naked Shaping High Waist Short</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SO2250599-1855-1_998x1498.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0545.jpg><ul><li><strong>Yitty Nearly Naked Shaping High Waist Short, £49 (£14.70 for members) from Fabletics - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fashionable, waistline doesn't roll down, stretchy, comfortable, seamless, recycled fabric, moisture-wicking, flattering, variety of colourways, variety of sizes</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;None&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>It's official: we're going to be wearing the Yitty Nearly Naked Shaping High Waist Shorts all summer long.

This bra has special 'anti-uniboob technology', which basically means it is designed to keep your boobs separate and defined. On top of that, the no-roll waistband (we love the build-in clingy silicone band) makes sure everything stays in place and the bra itself won't bunch up.&nbsp;</p><p>In our opinion, every plain T-Shirt I have looks so much better with this bra underneath than it does with our regular bras. This bralette really is undetectable under clothing.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=m0>Marks and Spencer Magicwear Waist Cincher & Thigh Slimmer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SD_02_T32_1503_Y0_X_EC_0.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0549.jpg><p><strong>Pros</strong>:&nbsp;4 neutral shades, available in sizes 8 to 22, waist cinching, thigh slimming, anti-chafing&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating</strong>: 5/5</p><p>M&S's Magicwear Waist Cincher & Thigh Slimmer does exactly what it says on the tin: it makes your thighs and waist look a little smoother smaller.</p><p>Available in 4 practical shades (black, brown, beige and tan), you'll find it easy to select a shade that works for your skin tone and outfit.&nbsp;</p><p>When we first tried these shorts on, we were concerned that they wouldn't fit well. It was easy to step into them, but getting them over our hips and stomach was challenging due to the intensity of the tummy control technology.</p><p>But, we appreciated the tightness once the shorts were on because it definitely shapes your body and keeps wobbly bits in place (even when busting some moves on the dance-floor!).&nbsp;</p><p>One of of the best things about these shorts is that the waistband goes all the way up to just below your bra.</p><p>This means that there's no big gap in your underwear and no random bulges where shapewear stops, leading to a smooth, seamless silhouette. In other words, you won't be able to tell you have shapewear on, especially because the fabric is mostly seamless.&nbsp;</p><p>The thigh control isn't as intense as the stomach control, but that's not actually a bad thing. If the compression was too strong around the thighs, it would cause fat to spill out from the bottom of the shorts.</p><p>Our thighs do look slightly slimmer, but we found that the shorts mainly helped with keeping our tummy under control, beating thigh jiggles as we walk and preventing chafing.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the material feels quite thick, I didn't overheat due to the clever moisture-wicking Cool Comfort technology.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=m0>Marks and Spencer Light Control Bandeau Seamless Slip&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SD_02_T32_6767_Y0_X_EC_0.webp><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>Cinches waist, flattens tummy, cool, smooth fabric&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can only be worn with certain dresses (not that versatile)</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>At a first glance, you'd think this was a regular bandeau dress with no sculpting power. But, when we tried it on, we realised that it's exactly what you want for a little bit of extra support underneath strapless or strappy dresses.&nbsp;</p><p>The fabric is super lightweight and cool, and the dress' main function is to cinch the waist and flatten your tummy. And it does exactly that.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=m0>Marks and Spencer Medium Control Secret Slimming Full Slip</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SD_02_T32_5931A_AC_X_EC_0-1.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0560.jpg><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>Doesn't require a bra, really slimming and sculpting, available in sizes 8 to 24</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;Only available in 2 shades, thick straps limit the dresses you can wear it with</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p>As soon as we slipped into this little number, we felt instantly slimmed down and ready to hit the town. It's super-flattering, sculpting and lifting, and you don't need to wear a bra with it.&nbsp;</p><p>For us, this worked well under a few different mini dresses. It's seamless and has soft edges, so you can't see it under your clothes.</p><p>Plus, the silky feel and shiny finish give it a luxury feel. However, it wouldn't work with a strapless dress (obviously) or a strappy slip dress because the straps are quite thick and would be visible.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=m0>Marks and Spencer Body Define Firm Control No VPL Full Briefs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SD_02_T32_6762H_AC_X_EC_0.webp><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, no VPL, smoothing and cinching&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;Only available in two colours&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p>We like our shapewear knickers to be thongs rather than full briefs, so we were surprised to like these so much. Often full briefs that claim to have no VPL are disappointing, but we can confirm that these didn't show through our jeans, fitted dress or satin slip skirt.</p><p>The waistband is just thick enough to prevent it from rolling down, so you don't have to worry about needing to readjust throughout the day. They're super comfortable, will softly define your curves and support your tummy, and they're pretty affordable too.&nbsp;</p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Spanx Suit Your Fancy Plunge Stretch-Jersey Body</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-shapewear-10.png><ul><li><strong>Spanx Suit Your Fancy Plunge Stretch-Jersey Body, £132 from Selfridges - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Material: </strong>51% elastane, 49% nylon<strong>&nbsp;Style:</strong> body<strong> Colours: </strong>black and beige <strong>Size range: </strong>XS to XL</p><p>Love wearing bodycon dresses with plunging necklines?

However, that's a testament to their holding power. These gave me the flattest stomach of any of the pull-in knickers I've tried. They're not tight when they're on either, they just make you feel as if you're being supported and smoothed over.&nbsp;</p><p>A brief wouldn't normally be my first choice, since they normally give you a visible line through your clothes, but the seams on this were pretty much invisible through my skirt. Plus, I imagine these are much more comfortable with a full coverage brief than they would be if they were a thong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Available in beige and black, there's an option to work for either light or dark-hued clothing.&nbsp;</p><h2>SPANX Thinstincts Thong Bodysuit&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Thinstincts-Thong-Bodysuit_Back.jpg><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_1216.jpg></p><ul><li><strong>SPANX Thinstincts Thong Bodysuit, £74.99 from Zalando - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, replaces the need for bra, breathable, thong, sweat-wicking, lightweight,&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only available in black and beige, no popper gusset</p><p><strong>Ratings:</strong> 5/5</p><p>Sculpting bodysuits sculpt the tummy and hips and replace the need for a bra, so they're perfect underneath T-Shirts, blouses, and some types of dresses. This one from Spanx has to be my favourite shapewear bodysuit, mainly because of how lightweight and stretchy it is. Especially in summer, you don't want to be able to feel the weight of the extra layer of clothing. And if you do get a little sweaty, don't panic because the fabric is sweat-wicking and absorbent.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of its actual sculpting power, I found that this bodysuit mainly flattened my tummy and the 'comfort crack' thong enhanced and lifted my bum. I have an average sized chest and found that I could go braless with this bodysuit since it offered some support and lifting.&nbsp;</p><h2>SPANX OnCore Open-Bust Mid-Thigh Bodysuit&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OnCore-Open-Bust-Mid-Thigh-Short_Front-1.jpeg><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_1222.png></p><ul><li><strong>OnCore Open-Bust Mid-Thigh Bodysuit, £86 from NET-A-PORTER - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, sculpts thighs, hips, tummy and bum, can wear your own bra with it, handy slit for easy bathroom trips, lightweight, smooth, adjustable straps, seamless</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only available in black and beige</p><p><strong>Ratings:</strong> 5/5</p><p>If you're looking to sculpt your thighs, hips, tummy, and bum, you'll want one piece of shapewear that does it all rather than wearing separate pieces of shapewear. This way, it'll look more natural and there won't be any tell-tale bulges.&nbsp;</p><p>This bodysuit is hands down my favourite piece of shapewear to exist. Every single detail is carefully thought about, from the adjustable straps, seamless neckline, back and cuffs, and the open bust to the booty-enhancing pockets and the double gusset with a slit for when you need the loo.&nbsp;</p><p>When I wear this shapewear I feel and look slimmer and my tummy looks flatter, but it's so lightweight that I don't feel bulky or as if I have a lot of architecture going on under my clothes. It's truly perfectly designed.&nbsp;</p><h2>Which company has the best shapewear?</h2><p>There are so many shapewear brands available in the UK in 2023 that finding the right garments for you can be tricky. The most popular luxury shapewear brands on the market are undoubtably Skims (owned by Kim Kardashian) and Yitty (Lizzo's brand with Fabletics), and part of this is down to their products going viral on social media time and time again.&nbsp;</p><p>The best shapewear company for you totally depends on your budget and preferences. There are more affordable options out there at brands like M&S, Pour Moi, and Everybody at Very.&nbsp;</p><h2>Does shapewear flatten stomachs?</h2><p>Yes, shapewear is capable of creating the appearance of a flatter stomach. Certain garments, like shaping shorts, briefs, knickers and bodysuits, will specifically target your stomach with elastic and rigid fabric that artificially holds in your stomach.&nbsp;</p><h2>Which type of shapewear is best?</h2><p>There is not a 'best' type of shapewear. The best shapewear for you depends on the area you want to target and what you're planning to wear it underneath. For example, a all-in-one unitard wouldn't work with a strapless mini dress because you'd see the straps. Equally, if you're fair skinned and wearing a nude or partially see-through dress, you should choose shapewear in a colour close to your skin tone rather than a black or brown garment.&nbsp;</p><p>You may need to own several pairs of shapewear for different purposes.</p><h2>What are the different kinds of shapewear?</h2><p>Thread's senior stylist, Millie Rich says that there are so many different types to wear depending on what you want to achieve.</p><p>"Controlling camisoles - perfect to help control your tummy; controlling tights/shorts - can be worn under dresses and skirts to shape your bum and thighs; corsets - on-trend garments used to make your waist appear smaller while shaping your tummy," she explains. "Body shapers - a full-coverage shaper that shapes your torso and your breasts; control pants - a great option for cinching your tummy and streamlining your waist; salf slips - perfect if you want to wear a mini dress or skirt, they shape your waist, tummy, and thighs; dress slips - like a half slip, a dress slip is great to wear underneath a mini dress and provides full support from the bust to the hips."</p><h2>Why does shapewear roll down?</h2><p>Rich says that the best way to stop shapewear from rolling down is to shop for the correct size. Pretty straightforward.</p><h2>Can you wear shapewear everyday?</h2><p>"There's no hard rules when it comes to wearing shapewear every day, but there are some things you should be aware of," says Rich. "There are different types of control levels when it comes to shapewear, but light control is recommended if you want to wear shapewear every day, as it is much more stretchy and flexible. Firm-control, on the other hand, is often more rigid and is best kept for special occasions, as it offers a lot of sculpting, but not much comfort.</p><p>"For the best breast support it is best to wear underwire bikini tops and bikinis with a push-up quality, which can help make exercise, such as swimming, more comfortable. Simply Be blends theirs with high elastane, nylon fabrics, and thicker straps, so you feel comfortable and supported all over."</p><h2>Does shapewear really work?</h2><p>Since <a href=# rel=noopener>shapewear</a> is a compression garment, it can smooth out lumps and bumps, accentuate curves and make whole areas appear thinner and flatter.</p><p>Shapewear is designed to make everything look smooth and is worn underneath clothes, such as dresses and tight trousers, but it won't create permanent changes.</p><p>Some people insist that wearing waist trainers can shrink your waist over time, but there's no evidence to prove that.</p><p>There is, however, scientific evidence to show wearing too-tight garments for too long can create digestive problems.</p><h2>How do I choose shapewear?</h2><p>The type of shapewear you choose depends on the look you're trying to achieve - and the occasion you need it for.</p><p>Be sure to pick the right size (the size you normally wear). Tone your legs with shapewear shorts or leggings, high-waist knickers can do wonders for making tummies look flat, and a shapewear bodysuit will smooth the whole torso (that's why it's a favourite under bodycon dresses).</p><h2>How much do body shapers cost?</h2><p>As with any item of clothing, you'll find body shapers at a range of price points.</p><p>M&S is a good option for budget-friendly shapewear, with 2-pack knickers starting at <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>£10.</span></p><p>Premium shapewear brands like Spanx are more expensive: you're looking at paying around <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>£60 for the Suit Your Fancy high-rise stretch jersey thong.</span></p><h2>Should you buy shapewear a size smaller?</h2><p>No, you should buy shapewear in your regular size.</p><p>Since shapewear is made from slimming, stretch fabrics, it will fit snugly over your body when you get the right size - that's how it was designed to work.</p><h2>What is the best shapewear for under a dress?</h2><p>It all depends on what sort of coverage you're after, but for occasion dresses, lots of women opt for a full bodyshaper or slip for the most seamless of bases.</p><p>If you feel like you just want some extra support in the form of a light control pant or tights, then these are really comfy and wearable options. Just do you!</p><h2>What is the best shapewear for tummy control?</h2><p>Anything that says 'firm control' is your friend if you're looking for sculpting in the tummy area.</p><p>Check out some of the briefs and shorts in our picks above: these will smooth your silhouette, without creating any unwanted bulges.</p><h2>What colour shapewear is best?</h2><p>Shapewear comes in a brilliant variety of skin-matched tones these days, so opt for something similar to your complexion for a completely natural look under light or sheer clothing.</p><p>Meanwhile, for more opaque garments, you can't go wrong with white or black shapewear – plus you can mix and match it with your other underwear.<i></i></p><h2>Where to buy shapewear?</h2><p>As you can see from our feature, there are so many places that stock high quality shapewear, including:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpoYmiCcoCXaJmeq6RiwKmtz56unpmiYsKsew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cls-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>CLs Boyfriend: Who is CL Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./see-selling-sunset-stars-chrishell-stause-emma-hernan-chelsea-lazkani-sexy-halloween-costume-photos-8384403.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>See Chrishell Stause, Emma Hernan and Chelsea Lazkani's Halloween Costumes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
