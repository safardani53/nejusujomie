She moved in with Bobby in Los Angeles to escape her “extremely volatile” mother, but quickly realized it wasn’t the place for her when she saw that Bobby “lived a very hotshot life, [full of] drugs and young girls.” Bethenny recalls, “It wasn’t a life for a little girl. I was always at restaurants or at the racetrack.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Bethenny’s mom re-married another horse trainer named <strong>John Parisella</strong> when Bethenny turned 5, which prompted them to move homes seven times over 10 years. Bethenny’s father cut her off when Bernadette accused him of keeping money from them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>And Bernadette’s marriage to John quickly turned hostile. “The house would be in shambles,” Bethenny says of her mom’s vicious outbursts in which she would smash “dishes, pictures, the TV — anything she could see” and physically fight with John. During these terrible fits, Bethenny says she would either have to hide in her closet or call the police to break things up.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Then came Bethenny’s personal battles with her weight. She began starving herself and purging at the age of 13. “I was owned by dieting,” she says. “I hated myself.” Her situation worsened when she began clubbing in her teens, drinking heavily and even doing cocaine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Wow… we had no idea Bethenny had such a troubled past, but it only makes it all the more incredible that she’s become so successful. A great husband (<strong>Jason Hoppy</strong>), an adorable baby girl (<strong>Bryn Hoppy</strong>) and a thriving career both on TV and in her line of Skinnygirl Margaritas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlgZH14e49xZpudpJ2yr7rYZp2rmZ6gsq15zJqpq6GRnLJur8eio52gn6Sxbq3BrqqeZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGWimq6teceorKydp57Dpr%2BMqJ1mppWserq70aRknKGkrnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-marie-tran.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Marie Tran- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-patterson-coach.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Sarah Patterson (coach) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
