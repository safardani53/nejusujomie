She noted that her mother struggled with alcohol addiction, and that she would often give Bianca food in order to placate her while she drank.</p><p>While things did improve for Bianca when her mom married her stepfather, she soon dealt with tremendous loss. Her mom, her stepdad, and her biological father all died within the span of just a few years.</p><p>After she had her son, Simeon, Bianca did try to improve her situation by getting weight loss surgery. She met Romonte following both of their operations, and her "bad habits" crept up again when she got pregnant with their daughter, Marcia.</p><p>On the show, Bianca explained that, because of her weight, Romonte was doing the lion's share of the housework and the cooking for their family.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though Bianca contributed to the household by working at a call center, she wanted to see if she qualified for another surgery to better her health for the sake of her kids.</p><p>When Bianca, Romonte, and her two kids first went to Houston, Texas to see Dr. Now, she weighed in at 604 pounds. While she did make progress during her next visit with a 46 pound loss, her third check-in did not go according to plan because she had been stress-eating as a result of turmoil in her relationship with Romonte.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Dr. Now did approve Bianca for the operation after her fourth visit yielded a total loss of 96 pounds. During the surgery, Dr. Now noticed that there was too much scar tissue remaining from the past weight loss operation for him to be able to do a full bypass. Instead, he put in a gastric sleeve and, by the end of the episode, Bianca had lost a total of 140 pounds.</p><p>During her update, Bianca shared that she was taking water aerobics classes to exercise, and that she was able to get a job bagging groceries.</p><p>Since her time on the series, Bianca has been very active on Facebook. Her page indicates that she does still live in Houston, and that she's continuing her progress with her weight loss.</p><p>"...

The two seemed to be on a break from their relationship by the time Bianca's time on My 600-lb Life came to an end, and it does not appear as if they have reconciled since the show.</p><p>Bianca shared a post on Facebook about single moms and dads in late October 2021, and she's also shared statuses about being alone romantically.</p><p>She last posted a photo with Romonte in July 2021.</p><p>My 600-lb Life airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7aiusKaZKaxXWt9cXnLm2SloZaaeq%2B71g%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./winner-several-award-great-hollywood-actor-william-fichtner-popular-for-his-movies-shows-know-how-much-his-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Look on William Fichtner's Professional Struggles: His Net Worth And Earning From Movies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-os-fiancee-became-more-comfortable-with-his-nudity-over-time.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steve-O's Fiancee Became More Comfortable With His Nudity Over Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
