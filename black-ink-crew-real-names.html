While several cast members didn’t have a problem sharing their love triangles, paternity drama, and business moves, many of them stuck to their nicknames during filming.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With Season 9 underway, Black Ink Crew original members, such as Ceasar and Puma, will return to TV screens. As the series progresses, viewers might want to know their legal names and who actually answers the monikers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ceasar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p><a href=#>Ceasar</a> is the owner of Black Ink and has operated it since the early 2000s.
