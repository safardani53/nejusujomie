It has been more than two months since <strong>Bobby Bones</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Sharna Burgess</strong></a> won <a href=#>season 27</a> of <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, but the dance former partners remain closer than ever.</p><p>“We just spent the last four days together,” the radio personality, 38, told Us Weekly exclusively at the 2019 iHeartRadio Podcast Awards in Burbank, California, on Friday, January 18. “I had a show in Nashville and she came out and made an appearance and we danced a little bit and then we went to New York together and I did my final Dancing With the Stars live show at Radio City Music Hall. So, yeah … we talk pretty much every day still.”</p><p>The Bobby Bones Show host also joked, “It’s nice to actually not be the inadequate one in the relationship now. Now we’re equals again.”</p><p>The 33-year-old professional dancer appeared on Bones’ radio show on Tuesday, January 15, and revealed that some of her past DWTS partners have <a href=#>tried to hook up with</a> her during the show. “It’s so bad. And then they get this attitude, ‘cause they’re so used to getting whatever they want,” she said. “And so, here I walk in, and I just tear them down to pieces about everything that I think of ‘em and why I absolutely wouldn’t go there.”</p><p>Bones told Us that while he does know who Burgess was talking about, he is not one of the men who tried to take their professional relationship a step further.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bobby-bones-on-sharna-burgess-relationship.jpg><p>“Sharna is one of my best friends now,” he explained. “But the thing is … pretty much all the dudes come in and try to hook up with all of their female dance partners. … And there have been a couple that I think she has had worse times with than others. So, I’m not gonna say who it is. I know, but it wasn’t me! I didn’t try to hook up. Zero percent.”</p><p>Earlier this month, the Australia native also revealed that she <a href=#>does not “speak to” all of her famous partners</a>&nbsp;from the past. The radio host didn’t go into detail about who Burgess is on the outs with, but did admit she’s “close” with DWTS season 23 runner-up&nbsp;<strong>James Hinchcliffe</strong>.</p><p>The American Idol mentor recently found himself in hot water with his radio colleague <a href=#><strong>Wells Adams</strong></a> after he alleged that Adams’ girlfriend, <a href=#><strong>Sarah Hyland</strong></a>, will <a href=#>buy her own engagement ring</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re supposed to be coworkers and friends,” the Bachelor Nation star, 34, fired back on the Wednesday, January 16, episode of his “Your Favorite Things” podcast with <a href=#><strong>Brandi Cyrus</strong></a>. “Can I got on the record right here? I <a href=#>will pay for this ring</a>, I promise you. It will come out of my bank account.”</p><p>Adams added: “I guess the thing that, like, grinds my gears the most about is anytime I seen anyone from that show, they’re so nice to me. They’re so nice to my face. Like, if you’re going to be a d—k, be a d—k all the time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabp5KXxm6uzqecrGWRo7FusNatqmaokafBr7HRZqqhmaKjrm6u1KuenqujYq6zsYysq6KknGKwrbvSnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-hazlewood.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Hazlewood- Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./baywatch-alum-donna-derrico-53-stuns-fans-on-instagram-with-youthful-bikini-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Baywatch Alum Donna D'Errico, 53, Stuns Fans with Youthful Bikini Pic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
