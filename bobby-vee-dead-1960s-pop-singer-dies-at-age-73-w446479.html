According to Velline, Vee’s death was “the end of a long hard road.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Vee (born Robert Thomas Velline) burst onto the music scene at the age of 15, when he was asked to fill in for Buddy Holly for a gig on February 4, 1959 — the night after Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. “The Big Bopper” Richardson died in an Iowa plane crash. To many, the tragic incident is known as “the day the music died.” It is also the inspiration behind <b>Don McLean</b>’s 1971 track “American Pie.”</p><p>Vee and his two-week old band — who went by the Shadows — were asked to play because they knew Holly’s songs well.</p><p>“I didn’t have any fear right then,” Vee — who played his last show in 2011 — said during a 1999 interview with the Associated Press about that performance. “The fear didn’t hit me until the spotlight came on, and then I was just shattered by it. I didn’t think that I’d be able to sing. If I opened my mouth, I wasn’t sure anything would come out.”</p><p>He went on to release 25 studio albums and had numerous songs on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Vee was also known for the instrumental part he played in fellow musician <b>Bob Dylan</b>’s career. Dylan (under the name Elston Gunn) briefly played the piano with Vee’s band in the early ’60s until both musicians made it big. The “Forever Young” crooner, now 75, was actually the one who suggested Velline change his last name to Vee.</p><p>Vee — who released his 25th studio album, <i>The Adobe Sessions</i>, in February 2014 — and wife Karen were married for more than 50 years before she died of kidney failure at age 71 in 2015. Together, they shared four children.</p><p>He is survived by his kids, Jennifer, Robert, Thomas and Jeff Velline. According to the family, funeral arrangements have yet to be planned.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabp5KXxm7CxJ5knZ2RmXpyhZVpqmaon6V6tLXNoJyrZZSesrR5wK1kmp%2BVYoR0edZta29sZ258</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cheltenham-festival-stable-tour-gordon-elliot-runs-through-his-potential-runners-for-this-years-festival-at-prestbury-park.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cheltenham Festival stable tour - Gordon Elliott runs through his potential runners for this year's</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amber-heard-trolled-poop-emojis-instagram-johnny-depp-bed-revenge.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amber Heard Trolled With Poop Emojis On Instagram After Johnny Depp Bed Drama Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
