lifestyle blogger has also had to endure Brendan boasting on social media about late night drinking sessions with attractive female dancers which took place after his shows.</p><p>Pressures with their seven-year marriage comes after <a href=#>The Sun revealed Brendan was partying with stunning golfer Carly Booth</a>, 25, on Tuesday afternoon at London’s Grosvenor House hotel less than 24 hours after his wife gave birth to his first son Dante.</p><p>A source said: “Brendan’s hectic touring schedule and his late nights out with his fellow dancers is starting to take its toll.</p><p>“It’s been a very stressful few months leading up to the birth and barely 24 hours after Zoe had Dante, Brendan is already back on the road.</p><img

much time apart is bound to have an impact on their marriage and Zoe is well aware of the female company he so regularly socialises with.”</p><p>The couple, who have a daughter Aurelia, five, wed in July 2010 at a lavish ceremony held in the grounds of Nether Winchendon House, Buckinghamshire, and the snaps featured in Hello magazine.</p><p>Brendan, axed in January after 14 years on Strictly,

seperate the two. To do the two together, would be very difficult.</p><p>“You come off the stage and your adrenaline’s pumping and you don’t want to go to sleep for at least three hours.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be in bed before two o’clock on a show day just because your adrenaline does not stop.
