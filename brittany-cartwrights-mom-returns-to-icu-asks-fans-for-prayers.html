I had kidney stones, can’t pass them.”</p><p>The Kentucky native, who has appeared on several episodes of <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> with her 31-year-old daughter, said that she received a “partial operation” the day before. “I’m gonna finish [the rest] in about a week to <a href=#>let everything get cleared up</a> before I have the rest of my surgery,” Sherri added. “I know one thing, this has been a hard year, definitely, on me and a lot of other people, I’m sure. So, if you all could please say a prayer for me, I really need it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brittany-Cartwright-Mom-Sherri-Is-Back-in-the-ICU.jpg><p>Brittany, who is <a href=#>expecting her first child</a> with husband <a href=#><strong>Jax Taylor</strong></a>, previously asked Bravo fans to keep her mother in their thoughts after Sherri required emergency surgery in June. At the time, Brittany’s rep <a href=#>confirmed</a> to Us Weekly that Sherri was “in the ICU due to serious complications from bladder surgery” and that the reality star was “planning to go to Kentucky to be by her mother’s bedside.”</p><p>Shortly after Sherri landed in the ICU, a source exclusively told Us that <a href=#>Brittany was “beyond overwhelmed”</a> by her mom’s health concerns and that her “sole focus” was on her family.</p><p>“That is undoubtedly her top priority and all she is concerned with focusing her energy on. Her mom is her whole world and she’s very worried,” the insider said at the time, noting that Taylor, 41, was “Brittany’s rock.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brittany-Cartwright-Mom-Sherri-Is-Back-in-the-ICU-02.jpg><p>The SURver’s Kentucky-based pastor, <strong>Ryan Dotson</strong>, <a href=#>revealed via Instagram in June</a> that Sherri had made it home from the ICU in good health. Two months later, Brittany <a href=#>gave a positive update</a> about her mom’s condition and thanked her followers for their unwavering support.</p><p>“I just want to say thank you to everyone who has prayed and sent best wishes for my wonderful Mom. ❤️ She has made an amazing recovery and is doing so so much better,” she wrote via Instagram in August, detailing her mom’s journey in the hospital. “The emergency doctors were amazing and they literally saved her life. … She is so strong and has come so far from the first days I stayed with her in the hospital. This was a very scary time but she is bouncing right back!! Please keep her in your prayers as she continues to heal for her next surgery.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though the past few months have been emotional for her family, Brittany is eagerly awaiting the arrival of her and Taylor’s baby boy.
