Many fans took to Twitter to congratulate the US team and commend the basketball player for her performance in the game.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Griner’s terrific performance aroused many fans’ interest in her life outside the basketball courts. Here’s everything we know.</p><h2>Griner Is Married to Cherelle Watson</h2><p>Griner is currently married to Cherelle Watson, who has taken up Griner’s last name according to her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Watson is a blogger by profession and has over 30,000 followers. Her bio reveals she is currently a law student and a former Baylor University alumni.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;profile, she got her Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Political Science and Government in 2014. Her minor was Family and Child Studies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The couple often shares pictures of themselves and appears very much in love.&nbsp;</p><h2>Griner Met Watson at Baylor University</h2><p>Griner met Watson when they were studying at Baylor University. In an old anniversary post on Instagram, the NBA&nbsp;star recalled the first time she met Watson and explained how she was immediately blown away by her beauty. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The two started dating and later split but rekindled their romance after Griner separated from her wife Glory Johnson, a fellow basketballer, in 2015 after a 28-day marriage.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Griner’s Messy Divorce</h2><p>Before falling in love with Watson, Griner was embroiled in a very public and bitter divorce with Johnson. The news of their separation came a day after they revealed they were expecting.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the days leading up to their wedding, domestic violence allegations surfaced against Griner, and she and Johnson were both detained following a brawl at their house. The gold medalist admitted she made a mistake, but not her ex-wife.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>This left the WNBA player bitter, and eventually, after their wedding, she filed for divorce. She also claimed that Johnson cheated on her and refused to be involved in the pregnancy, but the judge had different plans.&nbsp;</p><p>She was ordered to pay monthly child support for the two IVF twins Johnson gave birth to after their divorce.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Griner Engaged Again</h2><p>Three years after her divorce from Johnson, Griner proposed to Watson.&nbsp;She took to social media to announce the happy news and show off Watson’s beautiful diamond ring.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The athlete gushed about how Watson stood by her through thick and thin.&nbsp;Watson also shared her delight on social media, saying that it was a blessing to have Griner in her life.</p><h2>Griner and Watson on Having Kids</h2><p>On July 17, the duo celebrated their anniversary and took to social media to write a heartfelt tribute to each other. In her post, Griner thanked Watson for pushing her to be a better person and helping her through her dark days.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Meanwhile, Watson took a light-hearted approach and talked about how it would be the two of them until they had kids. Although she revealed little about their plans to&nbsp;become&nbsp;parents, it appears they might have given it some thought.&nbsp;</p><p>The happy couple seems genuinely in love, and it looks like for Griner, the second time is a&nbsp;charm.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqinsG1usSyZKCqmaOys3nWop2eZZOdsrOxy6WcZq%2BRqcCwuo2hq6ak</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-platt-noah-galvins-relationship-timeline-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Platt, Noah Galvin's Relationship Timeline: Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yellowstones-cole-hauser-reveals-kids-reaction-to-rip-beth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yellowstones Cole Hauser Reveals Kids' Reaction to Rip, Beth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
