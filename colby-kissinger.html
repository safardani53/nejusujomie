She begins the show with his girlfriend of one and a half years, Madlyn Riley Ballatori.</p><p>Colby issued an ultimatum to their relationship, meaning Madlyn must decide whether to commit to him or move on with someone else. During the first season of&nbsp;The ultimatum, six couples must decide about their future by dating other people.</p><p>Over the course of nine episodes (and a reunion special), they’ll decide whether to marry the person they arrived with or move on with someone else.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_of_Colby_Kissinger></span><strong>Early Life of Colby Kissinger</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reality Star Colby Kissinger was <strong>born on May 10, 1995 in United States</strong>. He is a year older than his girlfriend Madlyn Ballatori.</p><p>As for his education, Colby went to Texas A&M University from 2014 to 2016 for his degree in business management. Also, while competing at A&M, Colby simultaneously attended Binn College to study fire science.</p><p>Colby Kissinger was born to parents, Danny and Stacy Skinner Kissinger: As of 2022, they were 58 and 55 years of age respectively.</p><p>His mother, Stacy is a Baylor University graduate who went on to work at America’s Choice Billing Services. Talking about his sibling, Colby has a sister named Kirby Kissinger.</p><p>Kirby resided in Lago Vista, Texas with her fiancee Matt Ingram and their beautiful daughter. Sadly, Colby’s maternal grandparents have already passed away.</p><p>His grandmother, Jo Marie Skinner (a University of Texas-Arlington graduate) took her last breath on June 18, 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Colby_Kissinger_Age></span><strong>Colby Kissinger Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Colby Kissinger is 28 years old as of 2023</strong> as he was born on May 10, 1995. At this age, Colby has already made a mark as one of the contestants on Netflix’s reality dating show, The Ultimatum.</p><p>His youthful energy and charisma have undoubtedly contributed to his success in the world of reality television, and he continues to captivate audiences with his adventures in love and romance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Colby_Kissinger_Career></span><strong>Colby Kissinger</strong> <strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colby-Kissinger-1.jpg><p>On Netflix’s newest reality dating series,&nbsp;The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On, six couples have to decide whether or not it’s time to get married.</p><p>In most of the show’s couples, which are each heteronormatively comprised of one man and one woman, it’s the woman who sets the titular ultimatum, making their partner decide to either propose or move on.</p><p>But in Colby Kissinger’s case, he’s the one who issues the ultimatum to his partner,&nbsp;Madlyn Ballatori.</p><p>Let’s just get one thing out of the way:&nbsp;The Ultimatum&nbsp;is absolutely ridiculous. The show takes six already-established couples and pushes them to decide whether or not they want to spend the rest of their lives together.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_whole_mess_plays_out></span>A whole mess plays out<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Colby goes into&nbsp;The Ultimatum&nbsp;sure that Madlyn is the one for him, but the show’s whole experiment makes him start to question things. As you watch the mess of a season play out on Netflix, here’s everything to know about Colby.</p><p>Colby is a project manager at a project management company as well as an entrepreneur starting his own business.&nbsp;According to LinkedIn, he worked in several business and managerial roles, and before that, he graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in business management.</p><p>TAMU is also where Colby and Madlyn met. However, he was a project manager at GDB Rentals when he filmed The Ultimatum.</p><p>Reportedly, his job there was to oversee and execute timely completion of repairs and remodels within budget. Prior to that, Colby worked as an assistant manager at Group Automotive from Oct 2019 to April 2021.</p><p>Also, back from May 2017 to July 2019, he used to work as an assistant supervisor at ‘Superior Silica Sands.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Colby_Kissinger_Personal_Life></span><strong>Colby Kissinger</strong> <strong>Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Colby-Kissinger-.jpg><p>From the very first moment, Colby Kissinger saw Madlyn Ballatori, he was never afraid to admit that he wanted to marry her. However, Madlyn, on the other hand, believed that she could be happy with someone else as well.</p><p>No wonder, the couple made the perfect subject in The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On. Colby Kissinger and Madlyn Ballatori are possibly together now.</p><p>Moreover, a travel and hospitality agency OutfitterExpert (in 2021) labeled the duo as “Colby and Madlyn Kissinger,” meaning, the two may have already tied the knot.</p><p>Also, another hint Madlyn dropped about their relationship was through an IG post (posted months after filming ended) where she tagged Colby over a wall graffiti of a kiss.</p><p>But if we look back, no one would have ever guessed that the two would last.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Love_started_in_a_bar></span>Love started in a bar<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Colby and Madly first stumbled into each other at a bar where Colby was working.</p><p>And it was love at first sight for Colby. He recalled that he knew Madlyn was “the one” the moment he saw her.</p><p>“I just wanna be known as her man,” Colby explained on the show. To which, Madlyn replied, “I love him. He’s ready for me to choose him.</p><p>But I’m not ready to get married yet.” She felt like there were many opportunities yet left for her to explore.</p><p>And this was also the reason why she seemingly didn’t mind immersing herself in the process of the experiment. In a part, Madlyn even confessed that “The only thing scarier than losing (Colby) right now would be to marry (him).”</p><p>Thus, without hesitation, Madlyn went on to pursue the spark she found with Randall Griffin. But on the other side, Colby’s “trial marriage” with April Marie didn’t make any sense at all.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_nasty_turn_in_relationship></span>A nasty turn in relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>However, Colby did find someone outside the show and even went on to kiss her off-camera. The two then continued conversing through texts, calls, video calls, and even in person.</p><p>‘Naturally, this upset Madlyn. And the worst part, she received the blame for it. According to Colby, he only locked lips with her to make the entire experience “real” for Madlyn.</p><p>For this reason, the duo even got into a lot of nasty arguments in public.</p><p>But despite that, the two had their last dinner date together before the ultimatum day where Madlyn was all set to tell Coby that she’d changed her mind about marriage. Unfortunately, the argument popped up again.</p><p>And this time, Madlyn couldn’t pretend that she was the problem anymore. Colby’s Texas pride shines through all over&nbsp;his Instagram.</p><p>He posts about how&nbsp;he’s a “Texas Boy”&nbsp;and his&nbsp;signature cowboy hat&nbsp;makes&nbsp;an appearance&nbsp;in&nbsp;a few of his pics. Colby also&nbsp;enjoys hunting&nbsp;and&nbsp;traveling, which he highlights in a few of his posts on his grid.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Colby_Kissingers_Net_Worth></span><strong>What is Colby Kissinger’s Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>In 2023, he has an approximate net worth of $100,000 USD.</strong> Colby Kissinger’s income mainly comes from the work that created his reputation: as a reality star.</p><p>In 2022 his income was approximately around $67,000 USD.
