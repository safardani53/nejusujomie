Today they got paid, and didn't get the correct amount at all."</p><p>Meanwhile, Assistant Manager of the Plymouth store, Timothee Stewart said: "When I looked at one of my paychecks, I got $492.</p><p>"I divided that by how many hours I had, and that came to $9.20 an hour. That is way below minimum wage."</p><p>"I reached out saying this isn't correct, only to hear nothing from my managers," he added.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>While the Attorney General's office has refused to confirm or deny if there is an ongoing investigation into the ice cream chain, Brewer said she was called by an investigator from the office.</p><p>The store was ultimately shut down last week by The Plymouth Health Department when it became aware that staff did not have basic safety qualifications.</p><p>According to the Health Department, none of the staff at the store had ServSafe certification which is awarded following a course teaching basic safety training and protocols for operating a restaurant.</p><p>Stewart told the <a href=#>news</a> outlet that Karen Keane, Director of the Plymouth Health Department asked him for the "licensing and the ServSafe certification tickets."</p><p>"I showed them all of those things. All were expired," he said.</p><p>Jafferian added: "You have to get it renewed every few years just to make sure you know how to properly take care of your company and that has not been done."</p><p>Keane explained: "They did [have employees who were certified] but they are either gone or the people who are there, have ServSafe Certification that is expired.</p><p>"The one that I had looked at expired six months ago. When they couldn't produce any certification that is current, we had to close the store."</p><p>Keane was also unable to contact the owners directly after shutting down the store not once but twice.</p><p>"I have left messages. I actually talked to one of the employees when I was there, and asked them to give them a call at that time, but they said they weren't allowed to call them," the director said.</p><p>A week after closing the store, Keane walked by to find that the store had reopened.</p><p>She then asked the two for their ServSafe certifications but "they couldn't produce it," she said which saw her close the store again until the correct paperwork could be shown.</p><p>Cold Stone Creamery confirmed to The U.S. Sun that the store was "an independently-owned, franchised location."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Cold Stone Creamery is committed to best-in-class operations, and the fair treatment of all Cold Stone Creamery employees," it said.</p><p>"We are looking into the details surrounding this franchised location and claims about the restaurant owner’s operations and will take corrective measures where necessary."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbn90gphra2ibn6Gxbr%2FTqKWeZZOnsqK5xKuwZpqRqLiquoyrppuamaPAbr7Ir5ilZZaWtq2%2FjJqZq62gqXqkuM6srKudXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-burton-sheree-burton-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Burton's Relationship Timeline with Wife Sheree</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thomas-knyvett-college-attack-ashford-surrey-arrests.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Girls, 10 &amp;amp; 11, among 5 people arrested after shocking brawl in street near school</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
