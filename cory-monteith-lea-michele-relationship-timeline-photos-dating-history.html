The picture, which showed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jenna Ushkowitz</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Damiam McGinty</strong></a> shooting a scene for the season 3 Christmas episode, was quickly removed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>February 2012:</strong> After years of speculation, Lea and Cory finally step out as a couple — it’s official! The pair was seen enjoying a romantic Valentine’s Day date in LA. This is considered to be the official start of their romantic relationship — and they looked like they were so in love on their date. A week later it’s reported that Lea accompanied Cory to Vancouver, where the Canadian native treated his lady to some winter weather fun. This is the first of many trips they would make together to British Columbia.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>March 2012:</strong> Now that Cory and Lea are officially a couple, the pair is inseparable. Cory flew to New York, (which also happens to be where Lea was born), to host the GLAAD Media Awards and Lea came right along for the trip. Although she did not walk the carpet the couple was captured walking through JFK on their way back to LA.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>April 2012:</strong> Lea and Cory jet off together yet again. This time the couple is spotted relaxing by the pool in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where Lea was wearing a tiny black bikini. The very next week, the pair hits the desert for the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California. Lea all but confirms their relationship status by tweeting, “I just saw a really hot 6-foot-3 Canadian with at tribal arm band hanging by the pool. So happy.” When the pair returned to LA they were spotted on a slew of adorable lunch dates.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>May 2012:</strong> Although they have been inseparable for months and are constantly spotted traveling together, it isn’t until May 16 that we spot some PDA from the pair.

Next, they were seen loved up during a lunch date at a Vancouver sushi restaurant. The following week they were spotted at the Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in LA, where the pair didn’t leave each other’s sides.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>August 2012:</strong> Lea was shooting the first of her on-location scenes for season four of Glee, and Cory was right there by her side — although it wasn’t for work! Let’s not forget that his character, Finn, was away at boot camp. When she wasn’t working the couple was spotted holding hands and strolling through the city streets. The next time we see them in August they are both on the red carpet at the 2012 Do Something Awards.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>October 2012:</strong> The couple is stronger than ever when rumors about their relationship begin to circulate. Stories claim that Lea is jealous of Kate Hudson and allegedly claim that she was flirting with Cory, while other stories say Cory is jealous of Lea’s chemistry with her co-star Dean Geyer. Regardless of all the stories, they remain united and look happier than ever, proving just how strong their relationship really is.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>December 2012:</strong> Lea covers Marie Claire‘s January 2013 issue, in which she gushes about Cory. “I don’t even remember a time when he wasn’t my boyfriend,” said Lea. “No one knows me better than Cory. No one knows what it’s been like to go through this more than he does. Feeling like you have that net underneath you allows you to jump higher and go farther,” she said. “He makes me feel like I can do anything. For the first time in my life, I feel really, really settled and happy. I feel like the luckiest girl in the world.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>The Holiday Season 2012:</strong> Cory and Lea head back to Canada and spend Thanksgiving with Cory’s family in November. In December, the pair decides to celebrate separately with their respective families, but reunite for New Year’s Eve, where they rang in 2013 with Lea’s family in Hawaii. It’s around this time that Cory officially confirms his relationship with Lea on the Ellen show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>January 2013:</strong> Cory isn’t the only one to publicly acknowledge their relationship! After gushing to Marie Claire, Lea is spotted wearing a ‘Cory’ necklace. The same month the pair gets glam for the 2013 Screen Actors Guild Awards, where they are once again inseparable on the red carpet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>February 2013:</strong> The couple steps out for a Valentine’s Day, (and their one-year anniversary date!). They also attend PaleyFest together, where the couple looks loved up — as always.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>March 2013:</strong> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cory’s reps confirm that the star has decided to enter rehab</a> for the second time and is seeking help for his substance abuse addiction. His relationship with Lea proves to be stronger than ever as she stands by his side, publicly stating that she will be there for him every step of the way.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19><strong>April 2013:</strong> Sources tell us Lea was the driving factor behind Cory’s decision and can’t wait for him to get better so they can begin to enjoy their future together — and start a family. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lea can’t wait to have a baby</a> with the love of her life and thinks Cory will make a great father. It’s in April that Cory leaves rehab and heads right back to Lea. The couple immediately set off to Victoria, British Columbia where they enjoy a brief vacation and are seen bonding with Cory’s mom over coffee.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20><strong>May 2013:</strong> The co-star couple is spotted dining in Canada and cheering on the Vancouver Canucks against the San Jose Sharks at Vancouver’s Rogers Arena. Lea is so supportive she even shared a photo of herself decked out in Canucks gear on twitter. Next, the couple jets off to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico for some rest and relaxation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21><strong>June 2013:</strong> Cory makes his official return to the red carpet after his stint in rehab — and Lea is right by his side. The pair attended the 12th annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in LA.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22><strong>July 2013:</strong> Lea jets off to Cabo San Lucas for a quick girls trip, where she seems relaxed and happy — she didn’t look like she had a care in the world. It’s clear the star could never have predicted that the love of her life might have been in trouble. On July 13, Cory Monteith is found dead at 31 in his Vancouver hotel room. Sources exclusively tell us that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lea is totally inconsolable</a> at this time.</p><h3>Watch:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Cory Monteith Autopsy: Fatal Mixture Of Heroine And Alcohol&nbsp;</a></h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-23><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async alt="Subscribe to me on YouTube" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hl-yt-subscribe.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3><strong>Katrina Mitzeliotis</strong></h3><p id=content-paragraph-24><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow<br>@KatrinaCM</a></p><h3>More On Cory Monteith’s Death:</h3><li><a href=#>Lea Michele Is ‘Inconsolable’ Over Cory Monteith’s Death</a></li><li><a href=#>Celebs React To Cory Monteith’s Death: Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian & More</a></li><li>‘Glee’ Star Cory Monteith Found Dead In Vancouver Hotel</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH14e5BtZpynoq56rrvNrZyirJhiuaatjKagnKCVobJuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZquipZWhtq%2BxjKmfqKyfqHqlrdOipaBlmJ7AtbvRsmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./barry-cryer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Barry Cryer- Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Wife, Marriage, Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zara-deniz-lackenby-brown-love-island-who.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Zara Deniz Lackenby-Brown on Love Island 2023?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
