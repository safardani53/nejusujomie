We feel so blessed to be a part of the Buffalo Bills organization and to have their support. We also want to thank Coach Taylor and the Bengals for everything they’ve done.”</p><p>The athlete, 24, suffered from cardiac arrest after tackling Bengals wide receiver <strong>Tee Higgins</strong> during the first quarter of the Monday night game. Hamlin collapsed and medical professionals rushed to him on the field to perform nearly 10 minutes of CPR. His “heartbeat was restored on the field,” the Bills organization later said in a statement, noting that the NFL star was transported to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.</p><p>The statement added that Hamlin was “currently sedated and listed in critical condition.”</p><p>Following <a href=#>the accident</a>, the game was “temporarily suspended” before it was officially postponed.</p><p>Amid the Pennsylvania native’s hospitalization, Hamlin received more than $4 million in donations for his Chasing M’s Foundation Community Toy Drive via <a href=#>GoFundMe</a>. Hamlin’s family was moved and touched by the amount of “generosity and compassion” offered, noting in Tuesday’s statement that it “means the world to us.”</p><p>The family also asked fans to “please keep Damar in your prayers” and that they would release updates as soon as they have them.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Along with fans offering their support to Hamlin and his family, current and retired <a href=#>NFL</a> players took to social media to react, including <strong>Josh Allen</strong>, <strong>Justin Fields</strong>,<a href=#> <strong>J.J. Watt</strong> </a>and <strong>Kirk Cousins</strong>. The Bengals’ official Twitter account sent their well wishes to Hamlin at the time of the incident and the Ohio teams’ owner, <a href=#><strong>Mike Brown</strong></a>, released a statement the next day.</p><p>“First and foremost, the Bengals continue to send their thoughts and prayers to Damar Hamlin and his family. Our hearts are with everyone in this unprecedented time — what we can do is support one another.” read the statement shared via Twitter. “Last night was supposed to be a great night for the NFL and a great showcase for our hometown. Instead, the human side of our sport became paramount … and in that moment, humanity and love rose to the forefront.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ2Wv260wKajoqajYrOiucilsGaroJqurL%2BMqKytZZGitqV5x6KqZqCfqL2qwMCloLOZpJ68r3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./linda-vaughn.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Linda Vaughn net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-gok-wan-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Gok Wan Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
