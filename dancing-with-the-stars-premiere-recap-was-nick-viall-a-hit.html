For her first performance of the season, Nancy sure went all-out to make sure the judges knew she was there to win.&nbsp;</p><p>With an energetic dance routine, she delivered a show-stopping performance, and the judges seemed to agree that it was a great start for her.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 28/40</strong></p><p><strong>Chris Kattan and Witney Carson</strong></p><p>Chris and Witney went with the Cha Cha to "What Is Love" by Haddaway. Chris did struggle through the training process due to breaking his neck before signing up.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, having energy does not mean you can dance, and Chris can definitely not dance. All the judges seemed to agree there was no dancing and that would be a problem down the line if he remained in the competition.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 17/40</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/bonner-bolton-and-sharna-burgess.jpg><p><strong>Bonner Bolton and Sharna Burgess</strong></p><p>The duo performed the Cha Cha to "Move" by Luke Bryan. There was chemistry from the get-go with this pair. They are this season’s Jana Kramer and Gleb Savchenko.&nbsp;</p><p>Chemistry aside, Bonner seemed unsure of some of his dance moves, and it rubbed off on the overall package.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 22/40</strong></p><p><strong>Charo and Keo&nbsp;Motsepe</strong></p><p>Charo and Keo went with a Salsa to "Cuban Pete" by Mambo Compañeros. The duo performed well together, but there were some glaring issues.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, it seemed like they were both doing something different. This could be attributed to first performance nerves, and the judges seemed hopeful they would improve with age.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 21/40</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/charo-and-keo-motsepe.jpg><p><strong>Nick Viall and Peta&nbsp;Murgatroyd</strong></p><p>ABC sure loves Nick Viall. After being on two seasons of The Bachelorette, one season of Bachelor in Paradise and one season of The Bachelor, he’s now focusing his efforts on dancing.&nbsp;</p><p>There was always going to be tremendous hype about his performance, and he really turned in a solid performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick and Peta went with the Cha Cha to "Let Me Love" by DJ Snake and Tiësto feat. Justin Bieber. The judges even seemed to think there was something good with Nick’s dancing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 24/40</strong></p><p><strong>Heather Morris and Maksim Chmerkovskiy</strong></p><p>There was some pre-season hate for Heather because of her being a professional dancer for, you know, Beyoncé. It’s not entirely fair on the other contestants, but she was great.&nbsp;</p><p>She went with a Viennese Waltz to "Make Something Beautiful" by Ben Rector. The whole thing seemed a little too polished for the first episode of the season.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Scores: 28/40</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/heather-morris-and-maksim-chmerkovskiy.jpg><p><strong>David Ross</strong></p><p>Surprisingly, there was someone who seemed to give Heather a run for her money. After all the pre-season controversy surrounding the unfair advantage claims, David Ross was drafted in to perform a Quickstep with "Go Cubs Go."</p><p>The judges were full of compliments for the duo.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 28/40</strong></p><p><strong>Erika Jayne and Gleb&nbsp;Savchenko</strong></p><p>The duo performed the Salsa to "XXPEN$IVE" by Erika Jayne.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Erika performed to her own song, and it was a raunchy affair that got the judges talking. Erika has proven in the past that she is no stranger to controversy and it seems like she’s trying to cause it with this number.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 24/40</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/erika-jayne-and-gleb-savchenko.jpg><p><strong>Rashad Jennings and Emma Slater</strong></p><p>Rashad and Emma performed the Cha Cha to "24K Magic" by Bruno Mars. With a story that would anybody weep, Rashad delivered in his first performance with Emma Slater.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a slack performance that seemed to be on point for the full duration of it. More like this, please!</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 31/40</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. T and Kym Herjavec</strong></p><p>Producers said they were trying to get Mr. T on the show for quite some time, but he stumbled through his opening performance wit Kym Herjavec.&nbsp;</p><p>Kym was just too good a dancer to be stuck with him. Hopefully, they turn it around if they make it to the next stage of the competition.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 20/40</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/mr-t-and-kym-johnson.jpg><p><strong>Simon Biles and Sasha Farber</strong></p><p>Simone and Sasha went with the Tango to "Untouchable" by Tritonal and Cash Cash. It was up there as one of the best performances of the night.&nbsp;</p><p>Seriously, the dancing and chemistry were all there, and these two are definitely the ones to watch for the rest of the season.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges’ Score: 32/40</strong></p><p><i>What did you think of the season premiere?&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Sound off below!</i></p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Dancing with the Stars Season 24: Meet the Full Cast!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WAcLDAp5qippdixKrAx2aroZ1dqMGivtJmp6udnZ6ys7GMq5ycmaBixKK%2FjKegnKNdq7aiuMtmmGagmal8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fabolous-shot-in-nyc-misspelled-name-not-cited-as-motive.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fabolous Shot in NYC; Misspelled Name Not Cited as Motive</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-gadon-19870404-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Gadon (Movie Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
