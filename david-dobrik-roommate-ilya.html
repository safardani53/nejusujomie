The leader of the infamous Vlog Squad posted a new picture on Instagram, captioning the shot: "Everyone say hello to our new roommate Ilya!!! My plan to move everyone out of my hometown is coming together perfectly hahaha."</p><p>So, who is the newcomer that moved into David's house? Here's what you need to know about Ilya Fedorovich!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meet David Dobrik's new roommate Ilya Fedorovich!</h2><p>If you're a Vlog Squad fan, then you've definitely seen Ilya appear on David's YouTube channel since the beginning. Ilya is originally from the 23-year-old's town in Chicago and would regularly come visit the social media star in L.A., or David would make it a point to surprise his longtime friend, which would sometimes involve being shot with a paintball gun at work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, where does Ilya work?</h2><p>According to Ilya's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkedin</a>, he is the founding partner of Fly Plumbing Inc., which is an "expanding plumbing, drain, and sewer company focusing on providing services for management and facility management companies. Offering full 24 Hour service with technical support and on call staff."</p><p>He also hosts his own podcast, Take Notes.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He has a thing for Natalie.</h2><p>Ilya has been very open about his love for David's assistant and best friend Natalie Mariduena. Over the years, he has expressed his affection for Natalie, but it seems the two were only ever just friends. In fact, David's assistant is rumored to be in a relationship with another Vlog Squad member Todd Smith.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But, who could ever forget some of the best Ilya and Natalie moments. One of our favorite vlogs is when the two Chicago natives ate a chocolate bar with the black reaper pepper in it. Needless to say, the two were crying after a few bites of the hot candy, and Ilya even vomited. Yikes!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ilya is always down for David's crazy ideas!</h2><p>Again, if you've watched any of David's vlogs involving Ilya, you know that the influencer regularly challenges his friend to do something crazy ... or he gets drunk on camera. Whether he's ended up at the hospital, vomited in public, went swimming naked, chased down his phone on the side of the highway after throwing it out of the car, basically, there is always a funny story when Ilya is starring in one of David's vlogs.</p><p>So, if Ilya really is David's new roommate, we think a lot of insane stunts will be going down. Hey, he may even give Vlog Squad member Zane Hijazi a run for his money for the amount of times he falls down drunk.&nbsp;</p><p>And, we can't wait to watch!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Check Ilya out on social media!</h2><p>If you're not already following the Vlog Squad member on Instagram, you definitely should be! We're sure he'll post some crazy behind the scenes house antics on his social media, especially since he's now a resident at Chateau Dobrik!</p><p>Most recently he shared a picture of his new roommates, captioning the cute snap: "I’ve moved out to LA to start my ice cream business with David and Natalie!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63tcNmm6iaop64br7OqKSmmaSaeqq42Jo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jane-atkinson-e-scooters-above-law-government.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>E-scooter idiots think they are above the rules - it's time the Government put a stop to their lawle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kristin-cavallari-pal-slams-madison-lecroy-over-jay-cutler-drama.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kristin Cavallari Pal Slams Madison LeCroy Over Jay Cutler Drama</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
