He comes from a golf-centric family as David’s father, Bob Duval, was a golf instructor, and under his guidance, David started his journey in golf.</span></p><p>He graduated from the Episcopal High School of Jacksonville in 1989, the same year he won the U.S. Junior Amateur championship. Later, Duval continued his success at Georgia Tech, becoming a four-time All-American and earning the 1993 National Player of the Year title.</p><p>From 1997 to 2001, Duval secured 13 PGA Tour victories in his early career, notably winning The Open Championship in 2001. Duval’s major titles include the 1997 Tour Championship and the 1999 Players Championship.</p><p>However, the golfer faced a downturn in his career after 2001 due to his medical issues. His performance declined without any notable victory again on the PGA Tour, and as a result, he lost his tour card in 2011.</p><p>Later, Duval transitioned into a golf analyst and commentator role, continuing to contribute to the golfing community. Currently, he is associated with Golf Channel and ESPN.</p><p>Recently, in 2021, he started playing in the PGA Tour Champions circuit in 2022, embarking on a new chapter in his golfing journey.</p><h2>David Duval And His Wife Susan: Relationship Timeline</h2><p>David Duval and his wife Susan met almost 20 years back in 2003 at a Denver restaurant while he was in town for an international tournament.</p><p>After a year of meeting, they decided to tie the knot in 2004 and have been together since then.

Moreover, Susan has custody of her three children from her previous marriage: Deano, Nick, and Shalene Karavites.</p><p>David also has a great relationship with them. Duval once said, “Those are my kids; those are the brothers and sisters. We are a perfectly blended, blessed family that you could ever ask for.”</p><h2>David Duval: Personal Life and Family</h2><p>Duval comes from a family with a golf background. His father, Bob Duval, was a golf instructor and club professional, and his mother, Diane Poole Duval, was a member of the FSU Flying High Circus during college.</p><p>He grew up in Jacksonville, Florida, with two siblings: his older brother Brent and his younger sister Deirdre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/David-Duval-And-His-Father-Bob-Duval.png><p>The Florida-born has had a lot of struggles and tragedies in his personal life. When David was nine, his brother Brent developed aplastic anemia. David underwent surgery to help his brother and donate bone marrow.</p><p>Sadly, the transplant was unsuccessful, and Brent died due to sepsis at age 12. Unable to cope with the tragedy, Duval’s father moved out of the family house.</p><p>He also had many moments in his career where he struggled with his health issues. However, experiencing the highs of his significant victories and the lows of the challenges, Duval continues to contribute to the world of golf with his determination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCwwK%2BgnWWUqsOiuNJmrqKelWKuqLGMmqWdZaeeuKq8xJ2gmmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-tony-rombola-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Tony Rombola Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-star-moon-sign-birth-chart.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Kylie Jenner's star sign?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
