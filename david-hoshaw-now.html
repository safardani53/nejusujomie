The latest case to get the 20/20 treatment is that of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Hoshaw</a>, who was convicted of double murder when he admitted to killing mother and daughter duo Vonda Goyena and Angelique “Angel” Goyena.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The case shook the state of Virginia when it transpired in 2007, but where is Hoshaw now? Here's what we know about what became of the self-admitted killer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is David Hoshaw now?</h2><p>Thankfully, Hoshaw is in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Virginian-Pilot</a>, the convicted murderer plead guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to two life sentences for his crimes and denied the possibility of parole. He remains incarcerated to this day.</p><p>Prosecutors reportedly wanted to give Hoshaw the death penalty ahead of his guilty plea. On the charges raised against him, Hoshaw said, "For the sake of my family, I am pleading guilty to this crime."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did David Hoshaw do?</h2><p>When Vonda and Angel were murdered on June 30, 2007, investigators were initially at a loss when it came to leads. However, the pieces soon began to fall into place when they considered Angel's fiancé, Hoshaw, whom she had met on the internet.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Hoshaw's alibi made it difficult for investigators to place him at the scene of the crime. He had witnesses corroborating that he was at a Boy Scout camp roughly 80 miles from the scene of the crime the night that it took place. However, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Virginian-Pilot</a>, Vonda, who was still alive when police made it to the scene, said that "her daughter's boyfriend" attacked them before she passed away.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How was David Hoshaw caught? Investigators began snooping into his past.</h2><p>After Angel and Vonda's deaths, Hoshaw relocated to Michigan and began dating another woman named Amanda. That duo became engaged shortly after as well.</p><p>Despite his airtight alibi, investigators still thought Hoshaw could have committed the crime. When they investigated him further, they discovered that there were records he had abused and committed fraud against his past wives.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13NewsNow</a>, Hoshaw was arrested after evidence was found that linked his credit cards to locations near post offices where letters from an apparent admirer of Angel's were sent. He refused to cooperate with police, but when he spoke one-on-one with Amanda, Hoshaw confessed to the two murders, and investigators heard the confession through a one-way mirror.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63tcNmn6irmJbEbrrOsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./luca-percassi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Luca Percassi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeopardy-stephen-webb-loses-streak-kelly-winner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeopardy! champion Stephen Webb admits he 'hit a wall' after losing his 8-day winning streak</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
