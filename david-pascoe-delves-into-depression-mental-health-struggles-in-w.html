As time went by I was energetic, euphoric and feeling fantastic. Work was going well and after a long day I had energy to kill, so I decided to go for nights out a few times a week, I didn’t drink anything other than energy drinks and always drove.</strong></p><p><strong>A few nights a week become every night of the week.</strong></p><p><strong>I’d drive into town, meet friends, stay out until the last clubs closed at 6am and drive home and lie awake for a few hours until work started over.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>This process lasted a few weeks before I started to lose track of time. Initially just a few hours of a day, then a day until eventually I lost all cognitive understanding of who I was.</strong></p><p><strong>My entire being was on autopilot… work, party, half-sleep, repeat.</strong></p><p><strong>A knock-on effect from this current lifestyle was the headaches, to counteract this I’d get through one, two, sometimes three packets of pain killers to subsidize the ever worsening pain in my head and eyes.</strong></p><p><strong>I don’t know how long this lasted but eventually it all became too much.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>One night everything came to a grinding halt. I was exhausted to my core and I didn’t have the energy to keep going. In my head I’d convinced myself that I just needed to sleep, maybe a few weeks and then everything would be okay, I’d be fine.</strong></p><p><strong>I took everything I had. The rest, as you’ve seen, was me waking up in a hospital bed, feeling as though a freight train had driven through my body and mind.</strong></p><p><strong>I returned home and spent 3 days in and out of sleep, half dreaming but extremely unsettled and just feeling empty. I had a darkness in my head that can only be described as rock bottom, I was finished.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Time went by and, as per recommendation I returned to that original office of said medical professional to review my current situation.</strong></p><p><strong>The outcome… we are so sorry that happened to you, similar situations have happened to people on that medication”.</strong></p><p><strong>The result… “Take this medication, it will keep you on a level instead of a high” No.</strong></p><p><strong>I left that day without any medication, I wasn’t going to risk falling down the same rabbit hole based on a checklist and a “that didn’t work, try this” approach.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>What followed was a long, painful process of self-healing. Understanding that I could train myself to get past these moments of darkness, to not rise to these moments of hypomania and take control of my own mental health without having to use chemically induced intervention.</strong></p><p><strong>It wasn’t an easy road and there were always days where I relapsed. The darkness in my mind would flood in and I’d feel that loss and helplessness overtake me. I’d be in my car or on my bike and think “just a small turn and I can just end it here, it’ll be okay”.</strong></p><p><strong>This all happened many years ago, it forever sits in my mind as a time when I was at my absolute lowest.</strong></p><p><strong>Fast forward 10’s of years and I’m sat here watching myself talk about this period of my life and this is why.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Mental health is important.</strong></p><p><strong>The stigma regarding it is unhealthy. If we cannot talk about our mental health then we are going to continue to lose so many beautiful souls who feel alone, trapped, and with no way out.</strong></p><p><strong>I don’t want commendation, I don’t want praise or congratulations.</strong></p><p><strong>I just want to raise awareness of something that is so real, so predominant and so deadly to every man, woman and child that walks this earth.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>We are all human beings.</strong></p><p><strong>Everyone deserves to be heard.</strong></p><p><strong>Everyone deserves to feel that they’re not alone. Everyone deserves the opportunity to change their mindset and want to live.</strong></p><p><strong>Everyone is human, sometimes we just need a little help.</strong></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2Z9cLDAr6CdZaCWwKS7xGabnqSmmsButc2tpmaclaW%2Fpr%2FSoqanZZ2au7Wty2afnpmcqbVuv9OrrKCfnJrAbrXNZq5o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dralin-carswell-boyfriend-of-alana-thompson-arrested-after-high-speed-police-chase.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dralin Carswell, Boyfriend of Alana Thompson, Arrested After High-Speed Police Chase</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brittany-cartwrights-mom-returns-to-icu-asks-fans-for-prayers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brittany Cartwright's Mom Returns to ICU, Asks Fans for Prayers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
