It never felt normal,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Chucky</a>&nbsp;</i>star, 44, exclusively reveals in the latest issue of&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly.</i></p><p class=p1>Sawa rose to fame in 1995 with <a href=#>notable roles in&nbsp;<i>Casper&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Now & Then</i></a>, both opposite <a href=#><strong>Christina Ricci</strong></a>, earning him a coveted place in ‘90s teen heartthrob history. After a string of beloved flicks to his name, the Canada native ultimately <a href=#>decided to take a break</a> from show business.</p><p class=p1>“At 25 years old I stepped away from the business for five years and most of the time didn’t know whether I was going to come back or not,” Sawa <a href=#>previously told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in September 2017</a>. “I had done a series of four or five indie movies that I wasn’t necessarily proud of. Some were horror movies. After<i>&nbsp;Final Destination</i>&nbsp;everybody wanted me to do horror movies and some weren’t as good as others. I was just burnt out.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Wild America&nbsp;</i>star — who <a href=#>started acting at the age of 11</a> — eventually decided to return toacting years later, booking roles in the likes of&nbsp;<i>The Fanatic</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hacks&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Chucky.</i></p><p class=p1>“I showed [my kids] the&nbsp;<i>Chucky</i>&nbsp;trailer and they’re not having it,” Sawa <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in September 2021</a> of son Hudson and daughter Scarlett’s reaction to his SyFy character of Logan Wheeler. “I gave it a shot! They weren’t having the&nbsp;<i>Chucky</i>&nbsp;show, so I don’t think there’ll be watching that either.”</p><p class=p1>While Sawa’s children — whom <a href=#>he shares with wife <strong>Dawni Sahanovitch</strong></a>&nbsp;— remained wary of Dad’s horror role, the actor is more enthused. “I remember renting the first&nbsp;<i>Chucky</i>&nbsp;on VHS,” he recalled at the time. “When the audition came through to me from my agents, it was a no brainer. I jumped on it. They were, like, ‘Hey, we got this thing. It’s Chucky. What do you think?’ I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, I have to do this. I absolutely have to. I’m a huge horror guy.’”</p><p class=p2>Scroll below to learn more about the <a href=#><i>Now and Then </i></a>star:</p><p><span class=s1>1.

I’ve also wanted to revisit Anton Tobias from <i>Idle Hands</i>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s1>6. The one thing I miss about the ’90s is the video stores.</span></p><p><span class=s1>7.

I worked with an acting coach named <strong>Harold Guski</strong>n when I was 18. He changed my life. It was advice I needed to hear that wasn’t easy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s1>12. I never take anything home from set. Truth is, at the end of a project, I’m done.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s1>13.

My celebrity crushes growing up were <strong>Elisabeth Shue</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Alyssa Milano</strong></a>.</span></p><p><span class=s1>20.
