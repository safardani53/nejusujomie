Is she still sick?</h2><p>In 2018, Diane Ladd was diagnosed with pneumonia and told she had six months to live. She explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer Weekly</a> that her daughter, Laura Dern, immediately "went bananas crying, saying, 'You can’t die!

In 2021, the family celebrated Diane's 86th birthday with a cake in bed. She snapped a photo <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for Instagram</a> and wrote a sweet caption celebrating her mother.</p><p>"Nothing like waking up my cutie mama on her birthday surrounded by friends and cakes!
