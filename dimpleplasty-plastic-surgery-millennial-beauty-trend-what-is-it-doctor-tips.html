We decided to get to the bottom of this trend and we spoke exclusively to <strong>Dr. Wright Jones</strong>, Founder and Medical Director of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Muse Plastic Surgery</a>, regarding everything we need to know about the plastic surgery trend.</p><h3>1. What is the “dimpleplasty” procedure?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-2>“Dimpleplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to create dimples in the face, most commonly within the cheeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The technique can be also be used to accommodate the rare request for a chin dimple.&nbsp; Creation of dimples is a short procedure that can be done under local anesthesia in the office.&nbsp; It usually takes about 30 minutes, depending on the patient’s anatomy and surgeon’s technique.&nbsp; The procedure involves an incision inside of the mouth where a defect is created in the cheek muscle known as the buccinator.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no external incisions or bandages.&nbsp; The muscle is then attached to the undersurface of the skin so that the dimples are seen upon animation but not with the face is relaxed.”</p><h3>2. How much has this procedure gained in popularity & since when?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>“This procedure is gaining popularity due to its little downtime, enhancement of facial aesthetics, and lack of need for general anesthesia.&nbsp; Dimpleplasty has been a request that I have gotten for many years.&nbsp; Often, patients have raised topic after noticing that I have dimples that are congenital.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past two years we have seen our requests for dimpleplasty triple.&nbsp; The popularity of selfie photos is likely why we are getting more patients for dimpleplasties.&nbsp; Our demographic of patients most commonly include women of the millennial generation who fall within a middle to high socioeconomic level.”</p><h3>3. What is the down time?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>“It’s important to know that the dimpling may be present constantly for 1-2 months along with mild swelling and soreness following the surgery.&nbsp; Therefore, one may want to consider postponing any major public engagements during this period.&nbsp; Afterwards, the tissue settles and the indentation should only be seen when smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the initial changes patients may return to work as early as the next day if they are comfortable with the appearance of the persistent cheek depression.”</p><h3>4. How much does this procedure cost?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>“The price range is usually between $800-$2500, depending on the level of difficulty and the surgeon’s reputation.”</p><h3>5. Is it permanent?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I often tell my patients that no procedure is completely permanent because the body will continue to change as we age.&nbsp; With a proper technique one should anticipate permanent dimples that are dependent on a multitude of factors such as heredity, fluctuations in body weight, aging, and environmental factors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, it is a niche operation that should give results that can be enjoyed for many years.”</p><h3>6. From your patients who have had this done, what celebrities have they asked to mimic?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Gabrielle Union is by far the most frequently mentioned celebrity by my patients during a consultation for dimples. But I have also been shown pictures of Brad Pitt, Eddie Cibrian, and Miranda Kerr.”</p><h3>Additional Tips:</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>“It is a finesse technique that requires a clear understanding of aesthetic goals between the patient and an experienced board-certified plastic surgeon.&nbsp; Otherwise, dimples could be overly dramatic, appear underwhelming, look unnatural, disappear with time, or even be located in the wrong place.&nbsp; Remember that although this is a great technique that has little downtime there are risks that could lead to deformities that are incredibly difficult to correct.&nbsp;Choose your surgeon carefully.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH14e5BsZp2hnaW5przLmqqtsV2luaK%2F06KaZqulp7SmvthmpKKknJq7r7XApWSbnZGqwbp506ucp5xdrLWiwIyiqmahpGKxsK%2FTqKlmrJmlwHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-woods-parents-michelle-steve-woods.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who are Laura Woods' parents, Michelle and Steve Woods?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sometimes-when-we-touch-is-set-to-released-on-paramount.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sometimes When We Touch Is Set To Released On Paramount+</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
