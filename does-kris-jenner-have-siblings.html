Then she became a member of the royal family.</p><p>So, our Karen has also become an aunt to the Kardashian family’s kids.</p><p>But believe us when we say that if someone is related to that family, then they will become a popular celebrity.</p><p>Regardless of their relationship with the family, all media attention will be focused on them.

And even Karen acknowledged that.</p><p>But a few years ago, Karen Houghton was hospitalized for medical reasons.</p><p>But Kris didn’t make her visit to Karen.</p><p>No one, however, can do this to their adored sister. Will everyone’s heart race if they see their sister in that condition? But it wasn’t for Kris.</p><p>That incident affected Karen. She publicly stated that Kris had changed and that her money and fame had made her forget her family and become rude. Etc.</p><p>We want to emphasize the fault on the Karen side too.</p><p>Sisters are born to fight and pull their hair out. But it doesn’t mean they will defame their sister in public. Family matters above everything.</p><p>Following the wrongdoings of both sisters, the relationship became strained.</p><p>Karen and Kris would then realise their errors and be reunited in 2019.</p><p>Even now, they have frequently been visiting each other, and we can see that in the posts of Karen’s daughter.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Kris_Jenners_Brother></span>Who is Kris Jenner’s Brother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kris Jenner’s mother is Mary Jo, who divorced her father and married the businessman Harry Shannon.</p><p>Mary Jo and Harry welcomed their son, Steve Shannon.

And she has been a part of serving in people’s lives for many years.</p><p>But she is also a great cook, so Karen has released two books to help others with their cooking. Karen published Volume One of Naturally Gourmet Cookbook in 2010 and Volume Two in 2013.</p><p>However, writing a book is not an easy task. We must have some implicit knowledge to share with others.</p><p>Thus, it shows that Karen is a more knowledgeable person. Why?
