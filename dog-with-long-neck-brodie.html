Azawakhs, or sighthounds, already have incredibly long necks, but the amputation makes Brodie look even more elongated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Brodie is absolutely the most beautiful dog I think I will ever lay eyes on. I'm a sighthound fan, and Azawakhs are one of my favorite breeds," Crook, a marketing consultant from the Middle East, told SWNS. "Even in the state Brodie was in when I first saw him — unable to walk and in such pain — he still took my breath away."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SWNS</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He does have a very long neck, but it looks ridiculously long from certain angles because his missing shoulder makes him slimmer at the base of his neck," the caring owner added. "So sometimes it looks like he is just one big neck with legs attached, albeit only three of them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now fully healed, Brodie is comfortable in his forever home and often shows his appreciation for Crook.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have a very special bond with Brodie. He has always seemed so grateful for his new life after his car accident," Crook said. "He is incredibly sweet to me. He loves early mornings in the kitchen with me when none of my other dogs are awake, and he gets me all to himself. He is the only morning person I have in my life."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SWNS</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brodie's owner is grateful for the pooch too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"From Brodie, I definitely learned not to give up so easily. I was so certain there was no hope and got so close to calling it for him. I shudder to think of it now seeing how he thrived," Crook said. "It is something that has helped me with other dogs that have come into my life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Brodie is the dog I look to when I need to stop feeling sorry for myself. I will never have it as bad as he had it, and he got through it all like it was nothing and with a smile on his face," she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CawbR7w6ieZq%2BZqbVuuM6nnmamlZi4bq7RqJuinV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bella-morgan-19991208-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bella Morgan (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./arlen-ness.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Arlen Ness</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
