Eight years after <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their feud</a> began, Drake, 36, was joined by Meek, 36, as he arrived at his concert for the Philadelphia stop on his <strong>It’s All A Blur&nbsp;Tour</strong> on Monday night (July 31). Drake didn’t bring Meek out on the stage during the show, but he did talk about his former rivalry with the Philly native and how they’ve since made up.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Drake walked out with Meek Mill at his show in Philadelphia tonight 🤝 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/YnznP83UNv</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— XXL Magazine (@XXL) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 1, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Y’all see who I walked out here with right?” Drake said to the crowd at the Wells Fargo Center. “I’d always keep it 100 with you. The last time I was in this building, that man right here, he’s been representing this city since he started this shit. That man, me and him weren’t getting along at the time, and he is a real n**** so he definitely got us up out of Philly real quick we did not get to stick around and chill.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Drake continued, “It means the most to me that I could come back to this city and show the growth as two men that we can come here tonight and we can represent for motherf****** Philadelphia together. That’s what this s*** is about.” The<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> “One Dancer” rapper</a> said he “appreciates” Meek walking him to the stage, and showed love to Philly for “embracing” him, before he got his show started.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Drake showing love to Meek Mill in Philadelphia last night 🤝<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/B0QIjP6XMe</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>— Complex Music (@ComplexMusic) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 1, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The pair’s feud started in July 2015 when Meek claimed that Drake used a ghostwriter to pen his raps, including one of the verses that he wrote for a collaboration they’d previously done together. He went on a wild Twitter rant to call Drake out. At the time, Meek was dating Drake’s friend, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong></a>, and he briefly (sort of) apologized to his nemesis while performing onstage with Nicki. Drake later released a diss track aimed at Meek, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Charged Up,”</a> which caused a heated back-and-forth between the two rappers, both in songs and on Twitter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/drake-meek-mill-reunite-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>But after Meek’s release from prison in 2018, the guys <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>finally squashed their beef</a>. In September of that year, Drake brought Meek out onstage when he was on tour in Boston. They shook hands in front of the crowd to let everyone know that the feud had ended. “This really gave me peace of mind tonight,” Drake wrote on Instagram afterward. “Healing and moving forward created one of the most electric and gratifying moments of my career. @MeekMill, I’m happy that you are home and that we could find out way back to our joint purpose.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Come 2021, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Drake</a> showed support for Meek when the latter rapper released Expensive Pain, his second album to come out after his stay in prison. “Proud of you boy,” Drake wrote on his Instagram Story to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>congratulate Meek</a> on the big accomplishment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e49rZp2qkaCybrnEnqJmpZmhuW6%2BxK6loqyVYrCwusKeqa1lkZvBpr6Mn6yenF2rtqWxzmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-rusanovs-girlfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Rusanovs Girlfriend: Who is John Rusanov Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./duwap-kaine.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Duwap Kaine Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
