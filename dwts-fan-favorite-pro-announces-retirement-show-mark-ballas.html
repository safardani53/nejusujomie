I am unwell," she wrote.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE DWTS">READ MORE DWTS</h2><p>Other DWTS fans left their heartbroken reactions in the comments.</p><p>They later added a video of the sad moment.</p><p>Mark stood on stage with Charli and <a href=#>Emma Slater.</a></p><p>"I want to finish this by saying, I've done 20 seasons now," he said to the crowd, who cheered loudly.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"I started this journey when I was 21, 22, and honestly, being able to dance and perform for you fans, you guys are the best fans. I just feel like tonight is special since we're closing the tour."</p><p>He added: "Also, just give it up for this cast. But, my mom is here tonight, my dad is here tonight, my wife is here tonight, my wife's mom and dad are here tonight."</p><p>And then Mark delivered news that his fans did not want to hear.</p><p>"So, I just want to finish this by saying, this will be the last time you will see me dance in this capacity. I'm coming to a close tonight. This is going to be my last dance."</p><p>The crowd erupted in groans and shouts.</p><p>Mark continued: "I had the best time ever this season and this freestyle was just a great way to finish it off. This song means the world to me. Charli means the world to me. The D'Amelio family, you guys mean the world to me."</p><p>He then thanked the crowd and then teased them with another sort-of announcement.</p><p>"And I'm not saying this is the end. This is just the last time I will be dancing with a partner. And I wanted to finish this with Charli and I appreciate you guys so much."</p><p>The crowd gave him a standing ovation as the tour cast came out to give the 36-year-old hugs.</p><p>Emma, who was the MC of the tour, said that the "show wouldn't have been the same without him."</p><p>He then performed his last dance with the <a href=#>Tiktok</a> star.</p><p>Mark is the second-winningest pro in DWTS history, with three wins.</p><p>He falls just behind his best friend, <a href=#>Derek Hough</a>, who has won six times.</p><p>The pro made his comeback this season after not competing since Season 25.</p><h2>'UNWELL'</h2><p>Some <a href=#>Reddit</a> users screenshotted the Twitter user's tweet and took to the platform to comment on the shocking announcement.</p><p>"Selfishly, I’m sad because Mark is my all time favorite pro and I loved getting to see him create. But I’m also glad he’s taking care of himself, because we saw how hard this season was on his body," said one fan.</p><p>"I hope that he continues to create, even if it’s mostly from a choreographer’s role now. His passion for the art of dance was on full display last season and I’d love to see what else he has brewing in his brain."</p><p>To that, another fan wrote that they want him and Derek to do a Broadway show together.</p><p>"I think it was time for him, I am really sorry because he was fantastic and did something unique. It would be so great to see Mark as a main choreographer," wrote another.</p><p>A third added: "Always loved Mark as a pro, it's sad to see him go after such an amazing season with Charli."</p><p>"Aww! That's so sad! I was hopeful he'd come back," commented an upset fan.</p><p>"Stop," another fans wrote with a bunch of crying emojis.</p><p>"Bummed, but not surprised," said another.</p><p>"Wait a minute. WHAT?" asked a Twitter user.</p><p>"My jaw dropped way too quickly. What?" asked another.</p><p>"Nooooooooooo," said one last fan with a bunch of broken heart emojis.</p><h2>'THIS IS NOT THE END'</h2><p>Mark gave fans some hope when he said "This is not the end" during his speech.</p><p>DWTS fans would love for him to come back and be a choreographer for the show or a guest judge.</p><p>Others want him to replace Len Goodman as head judge.</p><p>"Time for @MarkBallas to now become Len's replacement on the judging panel and be the new judge for season 32!! PLEASE @officialdwts MAKE MARK THE NEW JUDGE!!" wrote one Twitter user.</p><p>On the Season 31 semi-finals, Len announced that he would be <a href=#>retiring from the competition show</a>.</p><p>The penultimate episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>DWTS</a>' season 31 featured several shocking moments from Witney Carson's pregnancy news to Gabby Windey discussing her split and, finally,&nbsp;<a href=#>Len</a>, 78, revealing his next chapter.</p><p>Ahead of the second round of competition, host Tyra Banks teased a big announcement from the judge.</p><p>Len told viewers: "Whilst we're all getting excited and looking forward so much to the finale next week, it will also be with a touch of sadness as this will be my last season judging on Dancing With the Stars.</p><p>"I've been with the show since it started in 2005 and it has been a huge pleasure to be a part of such a wonderful show, but I've decided I'd like to spend more time with my grandchildren and family back in Britain."</p><p>The head judge continued: "I cannot thank you enough, the Dancing With the Stars family. It's been such a wonderful experience for me and I'm looking forward so much to next week's finale. I'm sure it's gonna be absolutely brilliant."</p><p>Fellow judges&nbsp;Derek,&nbsp;<a href=#>Carrie Ann Inaba</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Bruno Tonioli</a>&nbsp;stood up and gathered around Len for hugs.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>As sad as fans were to see him go, they think Mark would make a great replacement.</p><p>Aside from DWTS, Mark has also been busy with his band, <a href=# aria-label="Alexander Jean (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexander Jean</a>, whom he is in with his wife, singer/songwriter, BC Jean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/elvis-night-15-remaining-couples-768801676.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/disney-general-entertainment-content-via-776158973.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/l-r-mark-ballas-bc-800418083.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZmaFeH2QaJuwrKNis6K6jJ%2BYr6einsGmec%2BrpmaZnqO8trrCnqpmqpWptrOxzJ6lrWWjnby4ecyaqaRlkpa5ra3SaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gigi-maguire-19790523-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gigi Maguire (Podcast Host) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beauty-fans-rave-prettylittlething-lip-plumping-lipstick.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Beauty fans rave about the 13 PrettyLittleThing lip plumping lipstick that instantly makes your li</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
