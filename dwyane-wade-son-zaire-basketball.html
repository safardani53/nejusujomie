That said, the basketball star wants to leave a legacy of his own on the court, completely separate from Dwyane’s immense spotlight.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Distractify, Zaire talked stepping out of his father’s shadows and shattering expectations.

Because he’s spent his entire life under a microscope, Zaire’s no stranger to the scrutiny that comes with being in the public eye.</p><p>“I would say it's getting a little easier as I get older — just dealing with the naysayers,” Zaire told Distractify exclusively.</p><p>The athlete opened up about his years-long mission to live up to critics’ expectations.</p><p>“I would say my whole life — it’s been that comparison [and] battle between, you know, either trying to be better to him or exactly like him,” he went on.
