But for someone who’s never liked my music ever and sees me as the punchline to a joke? For him to suddenly be like, ‘Oh, you’re not as s*** as I thought you were?’ That doesn’t mean anything.”</p><p>Eighth track, Curtains, offers the only departure to a more upbeat sound, and hints at Ed emerging from his trauma as lyrics suggest he’s “done with my hiding place” as he adds: “Tears dry and will leave no trace, and tomorrow’s another day.”</p><h2>Brighter outlook</h2><p>In later tracks on a record which feels at times chronological as well as autobiographical, he tackles his <a href=#>wife’s recent illness</a> in strikingly candid detail, recalling a visit to a doctor’s waiting room together in pretty acoustic number Sycamore with the lines, “Right now in the waiting room, emotions running wild, worried about my lover and I’m worried about our child.</p><p>“Waiting on professionals to tell you how it is, what’s he going to say after ‘I think you’d better sit’.</p><p>“Brace yourself, something’s about to hit.”</p><p>But closers No Strings and Hills Of Aberfeldy hint at the strength of his marriage — which has seen the young couple overcome trauma together — and a brighter outlook.</p><p>This may not be a collection of singalong pop anthems, but it’s hard not to be arrested by it’s poignancy and poise.</p><p>This is grown-up stuff by an artist deserving of his place at the very top of his game.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-left>Track by track</h2><p>For all his near unrivalled commercial success, Ed has never benefited from gushing critical acclaim – and he doesn’t care.</p><p>While global records have tumbl­ed, snooty music writers have at times poked fun at his catchy hooks and radio-friendly lyrics – dismissing his pop mastery as “lightweight” songcraft.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EdSheeranTheSumOfItAll_05jpg-JS814345069.jpg><p>But Subtract should silence even his most ardent critics, as it tackles life’s toughest subject matter with grace, humility and integrity – with tracks to move even the most hardened listener to tears as he pours his heart out in what feels as much like therapy as a ­studio session.</p><p>This is Ed’s most mature songwriting to date, as well as a brave and honest baring of his soul – with all the raw agony it has had to endure.</p><p>A melancholy tone is rarely broken during its 14 tracks – with mid-album song Curtains the standout change in direction, and a welcome relief from what can be a tough, but worthwhile, listen.</p><p>And while younger fans may be taken aback at the hard-hitting subjects tackl­ed – which include the grief sparked by the death of his close pal Jamal Edwards and his wife <a href=#>Cherry’s recent major health scare</a> – it may send a powerful message that even the most vibrant of stars can endure the toughest of times.</p><p>A proper record, deserving of proper recognition and here’s my track-by-track review...</p><p><strong>Boat:</strong> A sensitive and appropriate opener, Ed released Boat in the run-up to today’s album unveiling accompanied by a haunting video shot on the <a href=#>Suffolk</a> coast near his home.</p><p>As waves crash into the singer, he insists “but the waves won’t break my boat” – a positive mantra amid an acknowledgement of the tough times addressed by the subsequent 13 tracks.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★☆</span></h2><p><strong>Salt Water: </strong>Lengthy by Ed’s standards, but this is anthemic and ­layered – and sets a clear and determined tone for what is to follow, with the refrain “It was just a dream, was it just a dream?” hinting at the star’s uncertainty.</p><p>Strummed acoustic chords are backed by synths and strings which build and develop symphonically beneath strained lyrics.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★☆</span></h2><p><strong>Eyes Closed:</strong> The lead ­single, and as close as Ed gets to one of his trademark singalong ballad choruses.</p><p>Memorable lyrics evoke the sadness of lose and solitude following the <a href=#>passing of a close pal</a>, as he recounts “everywhere I look I still see you”.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★★</span></h2><p><strong>Life Goes On: </strong>Pure acoustic balladry, and among the most poignant lyrically as Ed sings: “Tell me how my life goes on with you gone, I suppose I’ll sink like a stone?”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★☆</span></h2><p><strong>Dusty: </strong>Lighter and with a faster tempo, Dusty’s lyrics are more esoteric and intriguing than the blunter and direct feel of others.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★☆☆</span></h2><p><strong>End Of Youth: </strong>Unashamedly sombre, this is among the more challenging listens on the album – but feels like for Ed it is perhaps the most ­poignant.</p><p>Heartbreaking lyrics and a sense of pained anguish are clear.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★☆</span></h2><p><strong>Colourblind:</strong> Perhaps the track the album could have comfortably lost – as it feels overshadowed by the songs either side of it.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★☆☆</span></h2><p><strong>Curtains: </strong>My favourite track on the album, and a welcome break in tone which concentrates the attention and allows some release before returning to acoustic melancholy.</p><p>Rockier than the rest of the record, the production is more layered to bring in heavier beats and layered <a href=#>guitars</a> alongside a sense of positivity after a turbulent time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★★</span></h2><p><strong>Borderline:</strong> A slight comedown from the enthusiasm and optimism of the preceding track, as Ed hints at masking his pain and grief with <a href=#>alcohol</a>.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★☆☆</span></h2><p><strong>Spark:</strong> A piano chord progression and complex string arrangements make this a standout – with lyrics hinting at the strain a recent event had put on his home life.</p><p>Great songcraft and powerful balladry combine with Ed’s strongest vocal performance.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★☆</span></h2><p><strong>Vega:</strong> Unusual yet emotive lyrics tell the tale of <a href=#>Cherry’s health battle with a tumour</a>, and a sense of being overwhelmed by pressures thrown at him.</p><p>Ed croons: “Gotta keep the focus, If we believe then she’ll get better.” Therapeutic and worldly.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★★</span></h2><p><strong>Sycamore:</strong> Pretty, wistful and moving, this leaps out as a highlight among the gentle acoustic tracks – and it’s difficult to overlook the immediately striking lyrical ­honesty that tells the story of Ed and Cherry’s visit to a doctor for what would become the terrifying tumour diagnosis.</p><p>Opening lines take the listener to the heart of Ed’s world and the garden of his home, before a visit to a doctor’s waiting room and the fear of the unknown – ending harrowingly with the line, “Sycamore in the field, a lonely tree – darling what will become of you and me?”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★★</span></h2><p><strong>No Strings: </strong>Another of the standout tracks lyrically, No Strings is a passionate love song and ode to Ed’s marriage and family. “If we can make it through this year,” he sings, “then nothing can break us”.</p><p>The track is packed with angst and emotion, but positivity and optimism.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★☆</span></h2><p><strong>The Hills Of Aberfeldy:</strong> A distinctly Celtic flavour hints at more upbeat possibilities, which never quite mater­ialise.</p><p>But as a closing track it points to a sense of tranquillity and serenity after a period of trauma and pain – and acts as a clear nod of gratitude and love to Cherry.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★☆</span></h2><h2 class=has-text-align-center>SOFA SO GOOD, SAM</h2><p>SAM Ryder played a blinder with his inspirational anthem Space Man at <a href=#>Eurovision</a> last year but he will return to the contest’s stage with an even more rousing single next Saturday.</p><p>I have learned he will perform his new single Mountain, which is about overcoming adversity, as the interval act at the final in <a href=#>Liverpool</a>, with the song coming out the day before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SHOWBIZ-Eurovision-Ryder-14585302jpg-JS812099955.jpg><p>In moving lyrics, he sings: “Rough seas might pull me under and dark clouds might dim my days.</p><p>“There’s always bright tomorrows and I close my eyes and I say, remember how you made it through the fire.</p><p>“Remember how you’ve come so far. An unstoppable force of nature. That’s what you are.”</p><p>Then in the huge chorus, he continues: “I am a mountain and down in the valley below is all that I’ve overcome.”</p><p>Sam wrote the song last autumn, weeks before <a href=#>he released his No1 debut album</a> There’s Nothing But Space, Man.</p><p>The singer, who finished in second place at last year’s event in Turin to <a href=#>Ukraine’s</a> entry Kalush Orchestra, told me: “I was sitting on my couch at home and wrote it.</p><p>This was the first song I’ve written by myself in years, which was really nice.</p><p>“This is quite special so I’m thankful that this idea fell out of the sky.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Designs on Dua</h2><p>SHE can sing, dance, model and act and now <a href=#>Dua Lipa</a> has become a fashion designer.</p><p>The Levitating singer has teamed up with <a href=#>Donatella Versace</a> to design the label’s La Vacanza women’s collection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GETTY_The-2023-Met-Gala-Celebrating-Karl-Lagerfeld-A-Line-Of-Beauty-Arrivals_ENT_GYI1487048719-JS8.jpg><p>She will be at a fashion show in Cannes, <a href=#>France</a>, on May 23 to launch the range.</p><p>Donatella said: “Working with Dua has been very exciting and I love the dynamic between us.</p><p>“Dua is strong, fearless and free, and her creative vision is exceptional.”</p><p>Dua, who <a href=#>stars in the upcoming Barbie film</a>, added: “For her to give me the honour of co-designing this collection and letting my summer inspirations go wild has been a dream.</p><p>“I am so proud of this collection and cannot wait to debut it.”</p><p>EMMA Willis is eyeing up a move to <a href=#>Radio 2</a> and will be tested out with a show next weekend.</p><p>The former Big Brother host will cover Michael Ball’s Sunday 11am to 1pm programme on May 14 as her debut on the station.</p><p>It is hoped it could pave the way for her to become a regular on the airwaves, which has proved a success for <a href=#>Vernon Kay</a> who has successfully made the move from TV to radio.</p><p>Emma said: “Well, this is exciting, terrifying.</p><p>“I’m heading into <a href=#>Radio 2</a> to sit in for the very fabulous Michael Ball. Come join me for some great guests and cracking Sunday tunes.”</p><p>She got used to grilling people during exit interviews on <a href=#>Big Brother</a> and will turn those skills to interviewing celebrity guests, as she will be joined on the show by comedian Ruby Wax and presenter Steve Jones.</p><p>Vernon spent a year regularly covering for other DJs on the station before being announced as Ken Bruce’s replacement, and will begin his mid-morning weekday show on May 15.</p><p>Emma is well liked by the nation, so there’s absolutely no reason why she can’t follow suit.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>PRIZE IS STUFF OF STREAMS</h2><p>THE Brits has launched a new prize called the Brit Billion Award, and a load of my favourite stars have already got their hands on one.</p><p><a href=#>Lewis Capaldi</a>, <a href=#>Rita Ora</a>, <a href=#>Ellie Goulding</a>, <a href=#>Coldplay</a>, George Ezra and <a href=#>Abba</a> are among those who have been presented with the new gong, which recognises artists who have racked up a billion UK streams.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rita_Orajpeg-JS814802944.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5b35cd24-3ac5-4fcc-881e-6ac8151bc418.jpg><p>Accepting his prize, Lewis said: “I am so buzzing to be one of the first artists ever to be given a Brit Billion Award.</p><p>“Never in a million years did I think any of this stuff would happen, but now it has, I will gladly accept each and every award.</p><p>“You have my address.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/george_ezrajpg-JS814806549.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>RIRI’S ROCKING HER BUMP</h2><p>RIHANNA is on a mission to reinvent <a href=#>pregnancy</a> fashion.</p><p>She wore this leather trench coat, which was mostly unzipped, to head out on a dinner date with her rapper boyfriend <a href=#>A$AP Rocky</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SPL6136761_010_Pregnant-Rihanna-steps-out-after-her-met-gala-appearance-with-asap-rocky-making-a-fas.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SPL6136747_008_Rihanna-shows-off-her-bump-in-a-leather-trench-as-she-and-boyfriend-ASAP-Rocky-step-o.jpg><p>The Diamonds singer teamed it with these thigh-high boots, a miniskirt and bra, while her bump was on full display.</p><p>I’m not sure the same outfit would catch on here, not least as most women would probably be frozen.</p><p><a href=#>Rihanna</a> is due to give birth this summer.</p><p>She and A$AP had their first child, a boy, in May last year.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>But she isn’t letting motherhood slow her down, as she has also just been cast as the voice actress for Smurfette in a new live action Smurfs movie, which she will also create music for.</p><p>That will be more appropriate for her little ’uns than most of her music videos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqYmeCd3yXb2aenF2otaax0ZqlrGWYlr%2Bzu9aipaBlnprEbq3Lm6ymZaOqr7W%2BwJyrZqqVq7amw44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-bieber-caught-in-another-miming-row-on-first-night-of-uk-tour-as-singing-continues-when-he-drops-microphone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Bieber mimes throughout his first six nights on UK leg of Purpose World Tour</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wyatt-oleff-girlfriend-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Wyatt Oleff Dating?
