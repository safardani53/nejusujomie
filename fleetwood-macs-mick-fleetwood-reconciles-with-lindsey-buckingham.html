Everyone plays an important role in our history, even someone like [our former] guitarist Bob Welch, who was huge and sometimes gets forgotten. Lindsey’s position in Fleetwood Mac will, for obvious reasons, never been forgotten, as it should never be forgotten. My vision of things happening in the future is really far-reaching. Would I love to think that [reunion] could happen? Yeah. I’d love to think that all of us could be healed.”</p><p>That said, Fleetwood refused to comment on the current relationship between Buckingham and Nicks, 72, whose on-off romance inspired the group’s 1977 magnum opus, Rumours.</p><p>“I can’t speak for the dynamic with Stevie and [Lindsey],” he told the magazine. “I don’t even need to protect it. It’s so known that they’re chalk and cheese [very different] in so many ways, and yet not.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fleetwood-Mac-Mick-Fleetwood-Lindsey-Buckingham-Reconnected-3-Years-After-Feud-Inline-2.jpg><p>Fleetwood, however, said he is down to collaborate with the guitarist again: “I know for a fact that I intend to make music and play again with Lindsey. I would love that. It doesn’t have to be in Fleetwood Mac.”</p><p>The core five of the Grammy-winning band have not appeared together since January 2018, when they were honored at the MusiCares Person of the Year ceremony. After Buckingham’s ouster, Fleetwood, Nicks, John, 75, and Christine, 77, toured with former Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist <strong>Mike Campbell</strong> and Crowded House frontman <strong>Neil Finn</strong> from October 2018 to November 2019.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Buckingham previously told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> that he was not “heartbroken about not doing another tour with Fleetwood Mac,” though he was bothered by the way that his longtime friends had cut ties with him.</p><p>“We spent 43 years always finding a way to rise above our personal differences and our difficulties to pursue and articulate a higher truth,” he said in October 2018. “That is our legacy. That is what the songs are about. This is not the way you end something like this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGafpJWawbi7zp1kppmTqHqutcKkZJ%2BklZrBuLvOnWSrnZOku6S1y56qZq%2BZqbVuuMinm6ydqWKvtq%2FKoqWgoJGifA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deavan-clegg-i-can-prove-that-jihoon-abused-drascilla.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Can Prove that Jihoon Ripped Drascilla's Hair Out!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-nunes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amanda Nunes Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
