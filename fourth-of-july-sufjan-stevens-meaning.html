He grew up in Michigan with his father and stepmother after Carrie, who had <a href=#>depression</a>, schizophrenia, and alcoholism, left the family when Sufjan was an infant.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Carrie died in December 2012, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchfork</a> reported. “She had <a href=#>stomach cancer</a>, and it was a quick demise,” Sufjan told the magazine. “We flew to see her in the ICU before she died. She was in a lot of pain, and on a lot of drugs, but she was aware. It was so terrifying to encounter death and have to reconcile that, and express love, for someone so unfamiliar.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He added: “I was trying to gather as much as I could of her, in my mind, my memory, my recollections, but I have nothing. It felt unsolvable. There is definitely a deep regret and grief and anger. I went through all the stages of bereavement. But I say make amends while you can: Take every opportunity to reconcile with those you love or those who've hurt you. It was in our best interest for our mother to abandon us. God bless her for doing that and knowing what she wasn't capable of.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sufjan released two new versions of “Fourth of July,” which one fan said “might be the saddest song ever written.”</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sufjan’s website</a>, the two alternate versions of “Fourth of July” that the musician released on his 47th birthday on July 1, 2022, were recorded around 2014 and were "recently found on old hard drives."</p><p>The "April Base" version was recorded in Bon Iver singer Justin Vernon’s April Base studio; the "DUMBO" was recorded in Sufjan’s studio in Brooklyn, New York City. “The song has recently had a resurgence with listeners — which may speak to a deep national grief and sense of loss,” the site added.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Indeed, a 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a> shows how the song has resonated with fans. “‘Fourth of July’ might be the saddest song ever written,” one person wrote. “The whole last verse is gut-wrenching.”</p><p>Another person commented, “I’ve probably only been able to listen, like, 15 times over the last five years because it’s so gut-wrenching.
