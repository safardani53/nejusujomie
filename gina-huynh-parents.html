The beauty has been rumored to date a few men in the entertainment industry, which has sparked plenty of interest. And after the 28-year-old model posted a series of Instagram stories, it appears that she may be in a twisted love triangle.

And Gina confirmed many people's suspicions with a May 17, 2022, Instagram stories post that revealed she has Vietnamese and Black ancestry.</p><p>Naturally, questions about Gina's parents have also become a factor. After all, the model seldom posts any photo of her parents on social media. And according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TechWittle</a>, not much information is known about Gina’s parents.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Gina Huynh's parents?</h2><p>The site reveals that Gina’s dad was a member of a South Vietnamese troop.

On May 17, 2022, Gina took to her Instagram stories to post a photo of <a href=#>Diddy</a> kissing her on the cheek. While there should be no issues since Diddy is a single man, things went left once Yung Miami caught wind of the post. In case you've been out of the loop, rumors have been circulating since <a href=#>June 2021 that Diddy and the City Girls femcee</a> are an item.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Yung Miami quickly took to Twitter to fire insults Gina’s way. “Somebody please give this b—h some attention,” Miami<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> tweeted</a>.</p><p>Gina immediately responded via an Instagram story, saying, “If anybody is seeking attention, b—-h it’s you.

Even though the pair were spotted holding hands at Quality Control CEO Pierre “Pee” Thomas’ birthday bash in June 2021, Yung Miami has denied being involved with the mogul in multiple interviews ever since.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Not to mention, it’s quite embarrassing for two beautiful women to be arguing over a man that’s not publicly claiming either one of them as his girlfriend. However, we must admit that the entire exchange was very entertaining.</p><p>Keep in mind, Diddy has not uttered a word on social media about the beauties going at it. I guess when a billionaire is up for grabs the girls lose their minds, even if he’s clearly playing the field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLavrYyhrLKmmGK9or7Ep6us</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lee-horsleys-wife-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Lee Horsley Dating Lee Horsley's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keith-bulluck.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keith Bulluck</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
