She also shared shots of the kids running through the park, and a frozen Mickey Mouse popsicle. She also posted a photo taken on one of the ride cameras, where she looked like she was laughing during a drop, as well as a shot with some of the other incredible moms in front of The Incredibles&nbsp;logo. “Happy kids, happy moms. Thank you, Walt Disney World,” she wrote along with the shot.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Gisele shares Vivian with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her ex-husband</a>&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tom Brady</a>,&nbsp;</strong>45.
