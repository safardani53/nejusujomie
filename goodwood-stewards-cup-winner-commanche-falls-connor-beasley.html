It’s a long old way down from Yorkshire to here, just shy of six hours it was in the end!</p><p>“Thankfully for me Paul Mulrennan was doing the driving and I could just chill out.</p><p>“I could have had a bucket load of rides up at Thirsk but it’s these days and these horses that keep jockeys like me going.</p><p>“It’s happy days now though, isn’t it? You have to take the rough with the smooth, there are more long drives back without these big winners than there are with them so I’m not one to ever complain.</p><p>“It’s paid off and he’s a horse high up in my pecking order and you have to stick with them and especially on days like these.”</p><p>The 25-1 shot unseated Beasley after leaving the gates at Royal Ascot and had to pass a stalls test to be able to take part at Goodwood.</p><p>Beasley and trainer Dods have put the hours in at home since he made fools of them at Ascot.</p><p>And their graft helped their speedster to become the first horse since Sky Diver in 1968 to do the big sprint double.</p><p>The ten-grand buy broke clean as a whistle this time around and was able to track long-time leader Justanotherbottle before shooting past and grabbing the nearside rail.</p><p>Beasley’s smooth move meant Doyle and Tabdeed had to go the long way around and that might have been the difference between first and second.</p><p>Sprint king Dods, speaking from Thirsk, said: “It’s what dreams are made of. To do the double is a special day for the team.</p><p>“And I’m chuffed for Connor, too. He can show people how good of a jockey he is on days like this.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>William Hill: Bet £10 Get £50 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong></strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></p><p><strong>Betfair </strong>-<strong> Bet £10 Get £30</strong> - <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: £40 in Free Bets when you place a £10 bet on Racing</strong> - <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet</strong> - <strong><strong>Bet anything and get £30 in Free Bets</strong></strong> - <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HER</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E</a></strong></p><p><strong>Ladbrokes </strong>- <strong>Bet £5 Get £20</strong> - <a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></p><p><strong>Coral </strong>- <strong>Bet £5 Get £20</strong> - <a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></p><p>William Hill: 18+.
