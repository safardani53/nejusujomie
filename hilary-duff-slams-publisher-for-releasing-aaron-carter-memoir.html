We would ask the parties responsible to remove the aforementioned content and that no further content be released without approval from his family, friends and associates.”</p><p>Original story below:</p><p>Calling them out. <a href=#><strong>Hilary Duff</strong></a> slammed expedited plans to release ex <a href=#>Aaron Carter</a>’s unfinished memoir following his November 5 death.</p><p>“It’s really sad that within a week of Aaron’s death there’s a publisher that seems to be recklessly pushing a book out to capitalize on this tragedy without taking [the] appropriate time or care to fact check the validity of his work,” the Disney alum, 35, said in a statement to <a href=#>E! News</a> on Thursday, November 10.</p><p>The <a href=#>book about the late singer</a>, titled Aaron Carter: An Incomplete Story of an Incomplete Life, has been in the works for more than three years, per USA Today. The author, <strong>Andy Symonds</strong>, spent that time interviewing Carter about the details of his life as a child star and his experience in the music industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hilary-Duff-Speaks-Out-After-Death-of-Aaron-Carter-Feature.jpg><p>“To water down Aaron’s life story to what seems to be unverified click-bait for profit is disgusting,” Duff continued in her Thursday statement. “In no way do I condone shedding any light on what is so obviously an uninformed, heartless, money grab.”</p><p>The How I Met Your Father star began dating Carter in 2000 — both were only 13 at the time — after the “That’s How I Beat Shaq” performer appeared on Duff’s hit show, Lizzie McGuire. The pair had an on-and-off romance until they called it quits for good in 2003. During <a href=#>their various breakups</a>, Aaron was often linked to fellow Disney alum <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong></a>. More than a decade later, Carter admitted that he had lingering feelings for his childhood flame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hilary-Duff-Aaron-Carter-233.jpg><p>“Don’t be that stupid douche that loses the love of your life forever … Like me,” the Dancing With the Stars alum wrote via Twitter in 2014, seemingly referring to Duff. “I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to better myself to get back to her. I don’t care what ANY of you think.”</p><p>The book’s publisher, Ballast Books, announced on Wednesday, November 9, in an official press release that the posthumous tell-all will be published on Tuesday, November 15 — just 10 days after <a href=#>news broke of Carter passing</a>.</p><p>The “Aaron’s Party” artist <a href=#>died at the age of 34</a> at his California home, a rep confirmed to Us Weekly at the time. When news broke of the musician’s passing, the A Cinderella Story actress <a href=#>penned a touching tribute</a> on social media for her late ex.</p><p>“For Aaron — I’m deeply sorry that life was so hard for you and that you had to struggle in-front of the whole world,” Duff wrote via Instagram at the time. “You had a charm that was absolutely effervescent … boy did my teenage self love you deeply. Sending love to your family at this time. Rest easy ♥️.”</p><p>Carter is survived by his 11-month-old <a href=#>son Prince</a> whom he shared with ex-fiancée <a href=#><strong>Melanie Martin</strong></a>. An official cause of death has yet to be announced but the Florida native was candid about his <a href=#>mental health struggles</a> and battle with substance abuse.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bulgaria native and the pop star dated off and on over the last three years and were engaged before they called it quits in February. The couple had their fair share of ups and downs throughout their relationship including a breakup, a reunion, a pregnancy loss and a rainbow baby.</p><p>“I was really looking forward to getting married and having more children with him,” the influencer <a href=#>exclusively told Us</a> days after Carter’s death. “I feel like we were very close and I was looking forward to spending the holidays with my family again. I am beyond devastated waiting until I can meet my wonderful soulmate again. We never gave up on our love and I feel like we both couldn’t live without each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahoZyWv7p5w66dn2Wjoa6uv4yprJukmai1pr6Mn6arZaKauaat0qKloGWRlr%2BwuoycmKuslad6rrHMqKCrZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rmt-chiefs-pay-tax-hmrc-cracking-missed-payments.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>RMT chiefs warn members to pay tax on windfalls from a union-saving scheme</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fourth-of-july-sufjan-stevens-meaning.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fourth of July by Sufjan Stevens: Meaning of Song, Explained</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
