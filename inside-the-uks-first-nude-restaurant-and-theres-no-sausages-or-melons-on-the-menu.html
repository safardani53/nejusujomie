They ease you in gently at The Bunyadi.</p><p>Then, like a guest in a fancy spa, I am led into a changing room and asked to disrobe and slip into a white towelling dressing gown. I’m then led to a candle-lit table surrounded with roughly-hewn wooden logs and told to strip off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000243450484.jpg><p>For hygiene reasons - and to avoid getting splinters in your bum - guests are asked to take off their dressing gowns and use them as a cushion between their cheeks and the logs that pass for chairs.</p><p>Much to my relief, each wooden table is cordoned off by bamboo and wicker partitions to avoid cross-table ogling.</p><p>Apparently, stripping off is some sort of metaphor for getting back to basics by liberating us from unnatural additives in our food. But sat there, all exposed on a tiny wooden stool like a naked gnome, I am not quite sure where the leap from natural food to nude dining came from.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000243450686.jpg><p>The food comes along thick and fast, presumably to make sure couples on Tinder dates have no time to give in to primal urges in the dark.</p><p>Incredibly, the waiting staff are also naked apart from fig leaves covering their privates - no wonder there’s a waiting list, this place is like Hooters without the modesty.</p><p>The restaurant claims to be aiming for an early man/Garden of Eden vibe but with all the flesh on show I feel more like I am trapped in a saucy scene from Game of Thrones.</p><p>Unfortunately, the menu misses a trick by failing to include a single course containing sausage or melon, making it all but impossible for nervous guests to break the ice with a bad pun – there is not a meat and two veg dish in sight.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">WHAT REALLY SHOULD BE ON OFFER</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Here's what we would have liked to order:</p><p><strong>STARTERS: </strong>Prawn cock-tail<br>Cock-a-leekie soup and a bap</p><p><strong>MAINS: </strong>Rack of lamb<br>Coq au vin with dumplings<br>Saucy meatballs<br>Pulled pork<br>Loin steak<br>Breast of game bird<br>Cold cuts from the buff-et</p><p><strong>DESSERTS: </strong>Spotted dick<br>Prof-tit-eroles<br>Knickerlessbocker Glory<br>From the cheesebawd: Camembare</p><p>In the kitchen I figure there must be a real Naked Chef, imagining Jamie Oliver in the buff, judging our flabby bodies and blaming too many fizzy drinks, until I am assured that for safety reasons the cooks are all fully clothed.</p><p>I tuck into delicious cured salmon with seaweed salad and sun-dried tomato-stuffed courgette flowers and manage to forget that I am naked for a moment as I wash it all down with some organic wine.</p><p>There are no ‘sizzling’ foods, to avoid unfortunate accidents and all the ingredients are fresh, natural and not full of preservatives. You can even eat the cutlery which is made from wheat and eggs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000243450601.jpg><p>Seb tells me: “The whole concept of naked food isn’t a new one. We just go a step further by using edible cutlery, man-made utensils and by giving the customers the opportunity to be naked too.”</p><p>The 33 year-old Londoner also says he was inspired by the body positivity movement on social media but I don’t think there’s much that would make me feel more body negative than my unsightly scars and rolls putting friends off their grub.</p><p>Bunyadi is billed as providing the experience of “ultimate freedom” and towards the end of the five-course feast I discover why.</p><p>Without my trousers on there is no need to loosen my belt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e8Wopp1nYWeDdn2UamaipqOesaZ506GcZq2bqHqntdGsq2ampZmybr7ErKuaraKWu7V5wKebZqyYmr%2Bmv4ynpmarkarAorPErGSoql2isq27zaxkqKZdqbWmecyepa5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lucy-hale-slammed-for-fat-shaming-herself.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lucy Hale: Slammed for Fat-Shaming Herself!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./grand-designs-million-house-five-years-to-build.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Grand Designs fans all say the same thing about 1m underground house that took FIVE YEARS to build</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
