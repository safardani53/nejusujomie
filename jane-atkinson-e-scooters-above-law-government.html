And causing absolute mayhem.</p><p>A couple of months ago I witnessed a grown man tootling along at speed on the pavement on his <a href=#>e-scooter</a>.</p><p>With noise-eradicating earbuds squished in his ear, he looked as if he didn’t have a care in the world.</p><p>People were dodging out of his path and one woman even had to step into a busy road to avoid a collision. I was appalled.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE JANE ATKINSON">READ MORE JANE ATKINSON</h2><p>But the accustomed southerners around me didn’t seem to bat an eyelid because this seems to be commonplace and nobody appears to be stopping it.</p><p>E-scooters seem like a brilliant idea. A cost-effective, time-efficient and environmentally friendly way to get around while taking in fresh air.</p><p>They have the same rules as those for <a href=#>motor vehicles</a>. There is no getting drunk, no dangerous driving, no chatting on your <a href=#>mobile</a>.</p><p>And just like a car or lorry, driving on a pavement is out and having a licence is essential.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Only e-scooters that are part of ­government-approved rental trial schemes are allowed to be used on public roads within the trial zones throughout the country.</p><p>You can buy your own scooter but it can only be used on private land with the permission of the land owner.</p><p>But that is where the problem lies: The rules. They are — clearly — being regularly broken and the police aren’t policing them.</p><p>And this week the ludicrous <a href=#>landmark case of Giovanna Drago</a> highlighted that.</p><p>It shows that people are not only ­getting away with illegally using e-scooters but want us to pay up when they come a cropper.</p><p>The 22-year-old was riding hers illegally and broke her left knee when her new £558 Xiaomi Mi Pro 2 hit a pothole in Barnet, North London, two years ago.</p><p>At a hearing at Central London County Court she said it took 20 months to fully recover from her injuries and she still has a painful, four-inch scar and “muscle-wasting” around the knee.</p><p>So she is suing the local council for failing to maintain its roads. Poor, law-breaking Giovanna said she had no chance to avoid the pothole because it was dusk and difficult to see.</p><h2>Pavements will be like the Wild West</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, the council argued her claim should be rejected because she had caused her own injury by riding an e-scooter illegally. Too right!</p><p>Her argument is that she was unaware she was breaking the law when she took the scooter on the road. She had ridden it only twice before her crash. She now wants to be compensated from public funds.</p><p>It angers me that this costly case ever got to court. As barrister Geoffrey Mott pointed out: “The injury was the consequence of her own unlawful acts.</p><p>“Ms Drago’s wrongdoing has clearly caused her own loss.”</p><p>A survey last year showed that 52 per cent of road users do not know the laws surround- ing e-scooters, 29 per cent thought private e-scooters can be used in public, and 16 per cent on the pavement.</p><p>Surely, if you own a vehicle, you should have to know the rules.</p><p>Those who sell and rent out e-scooters, and those who buy them and hire them, should all be told what you can and cannot do with them.</p><p>Ignorance may be bliss but it certainly isn’t an excuse.</p><p>If I knocked back wine, got into my car and broke my nose after crashing into a wall because of a pothole, could I really sue the council, claiming I didn’t know I was over the limit?</p><p>I truly hope not. But what is the real difference?</p><p><a href=#>Bikes</a>, cars, lorries — and e-scooters — all need to adhere to the rules on the road.</p><p>We need those laws and we need deterrents from the police and the courts or soon our streets and pavements will be like the Wild West.</p><p>We don’t need people driving illegally then taking councils to court.<br>Judge Jan Luba adjourned the two-day hearing before lawyers’ final submissions.</p><p>I hope for everybody’s sake she makes the right decision, else the e-scooter idiots who don’t know the law will keep breaking it.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Royal good viewing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/731b03d4-e5bb-44e2-abc1-103b6855465b.jpg><p>WOULDN’T you love to be a fly on the wall at Sandringham this Christmas.</p><p>The chat around the table will be amazing.</p><p>You’ve got <a href=#>Mike Tindall</a> facing the family after parading around in his pants on <a href=#>I’m A Celeb</a> and telling the world he <a href=#>“sl*tdropped” in front of mother-in-law Princess Anne</a>.</p><p>Then you’ve got <a href=#>disgraced Andrew</a> for entertainment.

And there are two doctors there who can still see people face to face.</p><p>This scenario is dreadful. But it’s the state we are in. <a href=#>NHS</a> figures last week showed that 1,900 of 6,000 GP practices in England still hold fewer than half their appointments in person, so what is the real difference?</p><p>There is currently a shortage of around 4,200 full-time-equivalent GPs. That’s expected to double within a decade.</p><p>The last time I got an appointment (also known as a phone call) for my three-year-old son it was with a cold and unsympathetic locum.</p><p>Dr Hall could obviously have moved to a new local practice. But she may not have been replaced for months.</p><p>And surely her elderly and vulnerable patients would prefer to hear the voice of a familiar doctor on the end of the phone than a complete stranger - when many appointments are by phone and video anyway.</p><p>Obviously everyone should be entitled to see their local GP in person but in the current climate the chances of that are very small.</p><p>As harsh as it is we all need to be grateful for what we can get right now - even if it is a long distance relationship.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Ole smoke, Em looks Spanish</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tennis-player-emma-raducanu-made-779199939.jpg><p>CONGRATULATIONS to <a href=#>Emma Raducanu</a>, who <a href=#>accepted an MBE</a> for services to sport on Tuesday.</p><p>She usually looks so glamorous, but I couldn’t help thinking she looked a bit like a Spanish matador.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Kennedy spends his winnings</h3></p><p>EX-FOOTBALLER <a href=#>Terry Kennedy</a>, whose <a href=#>brilliant reaction to winning £1million</a> on the Lottery went viral, has now shared snaps of him globetrotting with his partner.</p><p>Terry, 29, who was once a team-mate of <a href=#>Harry Maguire</a>’s but was forced into retirement by a knee injury in 2016, has spent the past year in <a href=#>Tokyo</a>, <a href=#>New Zealand</a>, <a href=#>Hawaii</a>, <a href=#>Mexico</a> and <a href=#>Turkey</a>.</p><p>How brilliant – and how honest.
