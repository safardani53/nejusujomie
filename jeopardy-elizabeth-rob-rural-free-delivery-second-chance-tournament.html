and had $13,200 to Rob’s $3,000 and Morgan’s $2,000 when she landed on the second Daily Double.</p><p>She decided to wager a sizable $5,000, to which Ken said: “Wow, pretty big wager.”</p><h2>'SORRY, THAT'S JUST TOO LONG'</h2><p>The clue read: “RFD, short for this, began in 1896; previously, about 65% of Americans lived in the 'R' area & had to pick up mail at the P.O.”</p><p>Elizabeth quickly responded: “What is Rural?”</p><p>However, there was complete silence, and the Daily Double clue vanished from the screen as Ken didn’t say anything.</p><p>She was left with a confused expression and the host didn’t rule for at least five seconds.</p><p>Elizabeth nervously laughed and said: “Oh, 'Rural…'” before giving up, and the buzzer ran out.</p><p>Ken finally said: “Sorry, I think that's just too long; we needed the full RFD, it’s ‘Rural Free Delivery.'”</p><p>She dropped to $8,200, and struggled after that - while Rob made a huge comeback, finding the last Daily Double, wagering $2,000 and getting it.</p><p>Going into Final Jeopardy, the game was razor-thin with Rob at $9,800, Elizabeth at $9,400, and Morgan at $5,200.</p><p>Final Jeopardy under Historic Geography read: “Of Spain's colonial possessions in the Americas, this 3,400 square mile one in the Antilles never gained independence, but did change hands.”</p><p>Morgan and Elizabeth were incorrect while Rob got it as "Puerto Rico," jumping $9,001 to win with $18,801.</p><h2>FANS REACT TO ROUGH RFD MOMENT</h2><p>Fans were impressed Rob jumped from last to first in the final moments but felt for Elizabeth and discussed the costly clue.</p><p>One fan posted to <a href=#>X</a> (formerly Twitter): "@Jeopardy why say 'this “R”…..' if you wanted the entire phrase? Too many clues are worded in a way that takes too long to decode!"</p><p>One <a href=#>Reddit</a> user wrote: "Elizabeth had it in the bag but lost it on that USPS Daily Double."</p><p>Another wrote: "I thought for sure Elizabeth had that, dang. But great comeback by Rob!"</p><p>A third argued: "Not knowing the final two words for RFD cost Elizabeth $10,000 and likely a big lead going into Final Jeopardy.</p><p>"But it wouldn't have been a lock-game. Rob, with his standard cover + $1 wager, would've still won with his sole get."</p><p>A fourth knocked: "Dumb wager by Elizabeth," while a fifth argued as there were around 14 triple-stumpers: "The clues in this game felt exceptionally bad to me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

starts with three qualifying matches of Season 37 contestants instead of new players.</p><p>On <a href=#>Monday's episode</a>, Deana Bolio advanced despite an awkward misruling in which Ken admitted he <a href=#>"inadvertently accepted"</a> her incorrect response.</p><p>She, Rob, and Wednesday's winner will face off in a Thursday and Friday final.</p><p>That winner (as well as one more next week) advances to the next tournament,&nbsp;<a href=#>Champions Wildcard</a>.</p><p>That will air directly afterward and pit the winners from this series against brief Season 37 and 38 champions - the lineup is yet to be announced.</p><p>The subsequent eight-week tournament's price is a ticket to the currently postponed Tournament of Champions.</p><p>This takes fans into December, but given the writer's strikes, what will air after that is unannounced.</p><h2>EVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT SEASON 40</h2><p>Jeopardy!'s&nbsp;monumental&nbsp;<a href=#>Season 40</a>&nbsp;premiered on September 11 and will run until July 26, 2024.</p><p>Ken&nbsp;is hosting the entire season solo, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;is not involved as it stands.</p><p>She bowed out in solidarity with the strikers, a big shakeup since she and Ken were tapped to split hosting after&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>'s&nbsp;death in 2020.</p><p>That's far from the only big change to the highly anticipated new season.</p><p>Aside from not having new contestants and no Mayim, the other major change is the clues.</p><p>The&nbsp;game show&nbsp;is re-using questions from past seasons while without its writers.</p><p>Showrunner&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Davies</a>&nbsp;explained on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Inside Jeopardy!” podcast</a>&nbsp;that it “wouldn’t be fair to have new contestants making their first appearance” on the show with material that isn’t original or that was written pre-strike.</p><p>"The material that we’re gonna be using is a combination of material that our WGA writers wrote before the strike, which is still in the database and material that is being redeployed from multiple, multiple seasons of the show," he said.</p><p>Davies also&nbsp;announced a $1,000&nbsp;<a href=#>bump in consolation prizes</a>&nbsp;and said that he admires and misses the show’s beloved writers.</p><p>The news caused a scathing response from&nbsp;<a href=#>Masters winner&nbsp;James Holzhauer</a>, who took&nbsp;to the platform&nbsp;<a href=#>X</a>,&nbsp;formerly known as Twitter, to&nbsp;<a href=#>call out the show</a>.</p><p>“If you don’t have time to listen, here’s the executive summary of today’s announcement,” James, 39,&nbsp;wrote, sharing a link to the podcast episode.</p><p>“1:00-2:00: Jeopardy’s writers are invaluable and we couldn’t produce the show without them,” he continued.</p><p>“2:00-15:00: Here is how we will produce the upcoming season without them.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the 2023 Tournament of Champions will not happen not until the strikes are over.</p><p>Several Season 39 champs, including&nbsp;<a href=#>Ray LaLonde, Cris Pannullo, Hannah Wilson, and Ben Chan</a>, said they would not participate in the TOC until the strikes are concluded.</p><p>Ken has&nbsp;<a href=#>faced backlash from some fans and former players</a>&nbsp;for his decision to cross the picket line.</p><p>Ken has kept relatively quiet on the subject besides&nbsp;<a href=#>resharing a statement from the show’s executive producer</a>&nbsp;referencing how the late Alex continued hosting during the 2007 to 2008 writers’ strike.</p><p>Mayim&nbsp;is also being replaced by&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>,&nbsp;which airs on ABC for the entire next season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Season 2 of Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;is set to air on September 27 and its first&nbsp;<a href=#>slate of stars was announced last week.</a></p><p>Her exit marks&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken's first time hosting all programming</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Jeopardy! and she won't return until the strikes and scheduled tournaments end, or at least until 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
