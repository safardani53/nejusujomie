Categories like 'Countries that start with N' and my dumb a** answers Bolivia. Then I'm like, Duh!'"</p><p>Another agreed: "They fit the entire Final Jeopardy clue AND category in&nbsp;a small fraction of the space. It really shouldn't be a problem."</p><p>"But people have 30 seconds to read that," replied a third, seeming to think the screen may be too crowded if so.</p><p>Another similarly feared: "Sometimes the categories are long though."</p><p>And a fourth also worried: "You have to be paying attention in order to answer correctly [at home]," - and that's undoubtedly part of the charm.</p><p>One commenter defended: "Does that matter? I have horrible eyesight and I can still read it in about a second."</p><p>And another: "Bear in mind that the contestants don't see the clue as we do at home.</p><p>"I don't think anyone is talking about changing it on stage. Just the broadcast.</p><p>"For contestants on stage, the categories are always visible to them.</p><p>"I think having the category the same font and size as the clue while underlined would be perfect," that user concluded.</p><h2>'NOBODY GET UPSET!'</h2><p>Over the summer,&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48, and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;were officially announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek.</a></p><p><a href=#>Mayim is about to replace Ken</a> in just days for a new <a href=#>Teen Reunion Tournament</a> which will then see her host more regular episodes afterward.</p><p>Davies has also launched the new&nbsp;<a href=#>Second Chance competition</a>, ramped up the show's&nbsp;<a href=#>social media presence,</a> and debuted the hour-long&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;tournament with a&nbsp;<a href=#>"Triple Jeopardy"&nbsp;</a>round in prime time - which had a <a href=#>mixed reception.</a></p><p>Davies has also launched <a href=#>Jeopardy!
