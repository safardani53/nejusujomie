Well played, Kelly! Best of luck to you on Monday."</p><p>One fan commiserated with the brutal scheduling gaffe that left Stephen having to win more games than usual in one day.</p><p>"That’s a grueling pace. You did great! To win one game is fabulous ..and you made it to the Tournament of Champions! Well done."</p><p>Another former contestant wrote: "You were fantastic! The exhaustion is no joke and I can relate to the Daily Double desert."</p><p>One more applauded: "My heart broke for Kelly as her mighty, from-the-start lead was slipping away and so I was thrilled for her when she got it right. I like her calm vibe, too."</p><p>A fifth was also excited for the new champ and wrote: "The winner tonight was not only the best player, she bet well in Final Jeopardy....so I am now rooting for her:-)"</p><h2>STEPHEN SEASON</h2><p>Stephen, 38, qualified for the&nbsp;<a href=#>2023 Tournament of Champions (which now only has male contestants)</a> earlier this week so he'll be back in <a href=#>September</a>.</p><p>He's the second contestant to do so in a week along with&nbsp;<a href=#>High School Reunion Tournament</a>&nbsp;winner&nbsp;<a href=#>Justin Bolsen, 18.</a></p><p>One interesting part of his streak is that he indeed only landed on five Daily Doubles (of 27) in nine games - which means he was relying on smarts alone.</p><p>Stephen has been correct on&nbsp;<a href=#>91 percent</a>&nbsp;of clues and now has the third-longest streak of the season behind&nbsp;<a href=#>Cris Pannullo (21 wins)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Ray LaLonde (13 wins.)</a></p><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Longmont Leader</a>, Stephen has been a Jeopardy! fan for 25 years “but he never imagined that he would be on the other side of the television.”</p><p>He took the&nbsp;<a href=#>Anytime Test</a>&nbsp;in 2020 because his wife "noticed that I knew all the answers" - who can relate?</p><p>Some fans knocked Ken for allowing him to respond&nbsp;<a href=#>"is that" instead of "what is"</a>&nbsp;in an earlier game and have spotted that he seemed hilariously stressed out while winning big.</p><p>He even admitted as much after his fifth win, which was a huge comeback moment where he doubled up in Final Jeopardy when he was trailing opponent Roy Camara.</p><p>Stephen earlier dished on Reddit: "After this game, I had to sit down in the restroom in the contestant changing area for a few minutes until I stopped shaking."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>When Mayim returns on May 1, fans will still get more of Ken as he is hosting&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy!
