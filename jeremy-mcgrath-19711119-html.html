He was most active in the 1990s, earning him the title of "Super Speed ​​King". McGrath didn't start motorcycling until he was 14 because he spent his younger years riding BMX. This experience helped him revolutionize the way supercross rides, using a technique he learned in BMX that allows him to go one or two lower when jumping by typing at high speed. and then absorb the landing weight in his body just like the way you cycle. a BMX. One of his BMX "tricks" on supercross, for which he is most famous is "Nac Nac", which gave birth to the sport of freestyle racing. McGrath won the AMA Pro Athlete of the Year award in 1996. Also in motor racing, he challenged himself in various types of motorcycle competitions.</p><table class=wikibox readability=10.5><tr><td class=wk_label>Nationality</td><td class=wk_value>American</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>(age), San Francisco, California</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1989 - 2006</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Teams</td><td class=wk_value>Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Yamaha</td></tr><tr readability=12><td class=wk_label>Championships</td><td class=wk_value>AMA 125cc Western SX - 1991, 1992–AMA 250cc Supercross - 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000–AMA 250cc - 1995, 1996, 1997</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Wins</td><td class=wk_value>89</td></tr></table><p>Motorcycle Racer Jeremy McGrath was born in San Francisco, California, United States on November 19, 1971.
