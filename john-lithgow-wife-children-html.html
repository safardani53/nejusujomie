He won two Golden Globe awards for his role as the Trinity Killer in the TV series&nbsp;Dexter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His two most recent books&nbsp;Dumpty: The Age of Trump in Verse&nbsp;and&nbsp;Trumpty Dumpty Wanted a Crown, have both gone on to become New York Times Bestsellers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Lithgow certainly has had a highly accomplished career, but what about his wife, Mary Yeager? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Mary Yeager, the Professor</h2><p>Yeager is a Professor Emeritus in the History department at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). She frequently publishes her work in academic journals. Her focus is primarily business, women, and history.</p><p>The couple met in 1981 and have been married for 40 years now.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">In an interview</a>&nbsp;with Pop Matters, Lithgow recalled that he met Yeager when they were "fixed up together by an old mutual friend."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Yeager was teaching in Los Angeles at the time while Lithgow was pursuing acting in New York. Though they were miles apart, literally, and in terms of their career goals, Lithgow believes these differences bought them closer together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He said, "She's a professor and I'm an actor, and those two people were never intended to marry. Their lives are so incongruous with each other. But I can't imagine living without her, nor she me."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Getting to Know their Children</h2><p>The couple has two children together, Nathan and Phoebe Lithgow.</p><p>Phoebe was born in 1982, just a year into her parents' marriage. She lives a relatively low-key life and is currently pursuing her medical career. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She has a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the University of Pennsylvania and is a certified Nurse Midwife who works in El Rio Community Health Center in Tucson, Arizona.</p><p>Nathan was born in 1983. He graduated from The International Culinary Center and currently works as a chef across different clubs in New York.</p><p>Apart from this, Nathan also dabbles in music production and is the vocalist and bassist of post-punk band, the Nomads. He also has a Bachelor’s Degree in Music and Photography from NYU Gallatin. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Lithgow’s Past Relations</h2><p>Before marrying Yeager, Lithgow was married for 14 years to Jean Taynton, a teacher who was six years older than him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The couple had one child, Ian Lithgow, who was born in 1972. He, too, is an actor and has featured in Michael Almereyda’s recent movie&nbsp;Tesla&nbsp;and HBO series&nbsp;Perry Mason.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In 1980, Jean filed for divorce when she discovered that Lithgow had cheated on her with Norwegian star Liv Ullman and several other women.</p><p>Years later, in his memoir&nbsp;Drama,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lithgow revealed</a>&nbsp;his tumultuous relationship with Liv Ullmann began during a run of&nbsp;Anna Christie, a Broadway show.&nbsp;</p><p>He also confessed to sleeping with other Broadway stars. He did not cite names but attributed his actions to suppressed adolescence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2B8qbqMpaCtoJekxG7DyJ%2BcZpuYnrmlvsSnZaGsnaE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aygemang-clay-19830425-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aygemang Clay (Stage Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./silh4nv-qg9w4gtm3wfrxlant9fq9vnc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Star Trek: Voyager Season 3 Episode 12: Macrocosm</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
