Cuoco’s third Christmas picture was of the trio in matching Santa Claus pajamas as their new parents kissed their daughter on the cheek.</p><p>“Merry Christmas!!!! ⭐️🙏💫♥️ @kaleycuoco,” Pelphrey captioned his own series of selfies, which were posted via Instagram on Monday. Matilda had a giant smile showing off her two bottom baby teeth as Pelphrey snapped the picture with his daughter.</p><p>Cuoco and Pelphrey took their relationship public in May 2022. In October of that year, the duo announced that they were gearing up to welcome their first baby together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kaley-Cuoco-and-Tom-Pelphrey-Cuddle-Daughter-Matilda-on-Her-1st-Christmas-3.jpg><p>While Matilda was <a href=#>born in March</a> of this year, the couple had <a href=#>their baby’s name picked out</a> way before they were even expecting.</p><p>“We looked at each other and it was like, ‘Would it be crazy to say if we had a baby we’d name her Matilda?’” Cuoco told Today last month. “You know when you first start dating and you’re so obsessed, and you’re planning your future children. It was that sort of thing.”</p><p>Cuoco added, “When we got pregnant and we learned we were having a girl, we were like, ‘Oh, my God — we have the name.’ We actually kept her name a complete secret until she was born.”</p><p>The actress gushed over her baby saying that the name was “so her,” adding, “she’s such a Matilda.”</p><p>Cuoco was previously married to <strong>Karl Cook</strong> for three years before she filed for divorce in September 2021. She was also married to <strong>Ryan Sweeting</strong> from December 2013 to September 2015. The biggest difference in her current relationship with Pelphrey is that Cuoco knew she <a href=#>wanted to have kids</a> with him.</p><p>“[Having children] was not a goal of mine,” Cuoco explained to Emmy magazine in May. “As a young girl I dreamed of it, but I became involved in my career. Then when we met, it was instantaneous. [I thought,] ‘Oh, my God, I <a href=#>want to have a kid</a> with you.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Both she and Pelphrey “wanted it so badly,” something she didn’t think would happen.</p><p>“I love my career and wanted to just keep living my life. But Tom came along, and something changed,” she added. “We’re not 20, so we felt like we probably couldn’t wait too long. Then we got so blessed — it happened right away.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakmZyaxm6v1KiaqGWkpLpuvMSlp6Gqla56pLHLnpmrmaSaeqWt1KCfrZ2iYrqiwMilm5qrXWbAtXnCoamiq6SirrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-and-chloe-grace-moretz-twitter-feud-over-swift-drama.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashian and Chloe Grace Moretz Twitter Feud Over Swift Drama</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-where-the-crawdads-author-delia-owens-is-wanted-for-questioning-about-a-murder-in-africa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Where the Crawdads Author Is Wanted for Questioning About a Murder</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
