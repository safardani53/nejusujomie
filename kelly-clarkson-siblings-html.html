But interestingly, not much is known about Clarkson’s personal life. More particularly, about her family ties. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So, here is a rundown of what we know so far regarding her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">brother and sister</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Kelly Clarkson Did Not Know Her Siblings</h2><p>It is interesting to note that before American Idol, the country-pop singer had never met her siblings. In a candid interview with Sirius XM, Clarkson talked about how her family separated during her infancy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She and her siblings did not get the chance to grow up together. But, to delve into more background, Clarkson’s mother was a school teacher, and her father was an engineer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They got divorced when she was six and moved away to different places. As she explains in the interview, her sister grew up with her aunt in North Carolina, her brother was in California with her dad, and she was in Texas with her mom.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, and coincidentally a year before American Idol happened, they got around to finally meeting each other for her brother’s wedding in Alaska. Before this, they had only known about each other’s existence.</p><p>Clarkson herself is the youngest of the siblings. Her brother, Jason, is the eldest, while her sister, Alyssa, is the middle child. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Now, all three live in 60-acre farmland where they shelter rescued horses, miniatures, dogs, and cats and hop between each other’s backyards for barbeque and cookouts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>The Trio Are As Thick As Thieves</h2><p>Earlier this year, Clarkson had an episode on her show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, about the reunion of a brother and a sister after 75 years. The moment was a heart-touching one, and in this tender instance, the singer shared about her brother and sister.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She expressed that although they never got the chance to grow up together, they are so much like each other. She attributed this to a particular magical connection that binds brothers and sisters to one another. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>All this being said, both of Clarkson’s siblings have a low-key profile. We know little of either, other than that all three are very much inseparable.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Her Sour Relationship With Her Father</h2><p>While the story of her reunion with her siblings directs towards greener pastures, her family life hasn’t always been merry. Her parent’s divorce was an obvious giveaway, which led to a rough and prolonged relationship with her father.</p><p>After the separation, she never really connected to her dad. Not that she didn’t try — she did. But every effort of hers was met with a silent wall.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In an intimate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with County Living</a>, she revealed she had eventually felt that his lack of compassion was humiliating.&nbsp;This detachment was the inspiration behind one of her most vulnerable songs, ‘Because Of You.’</p><p>In it, she expressed how the lack of love made her scared of love itself. Then, last year, she learned about his passing. This triggered her to give up the past and forgive him, and write the optimistically voiced ‘Piece By Piece.’</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She conveyed her motherhood and how she would always be there for her children through the song.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOVobm6ecKlmKujo6S7br%2FIm6Oippeoe6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./duan-jansen-parents-brother.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Duan Jansen And Brother Marco Jansen Got Into Cricket</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lawyer-delonte-west-is-not-doing-lebrons-mom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Delonte West Not Putting it to LeBron's Mom</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
