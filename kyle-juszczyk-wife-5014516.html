He’s been a key part of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>San Francisco 49ers’</a> playoff efforts as the team tries to make it to Super Bowl LVI. The fullback, 31, who became the highest-paid fullback in the NFL in 2021 (per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Post</a>), has had his wife&nbsp;<strong>Kristin&nbsp;</strong>by his side to cheer him on, as he works his way towards a successful season. Find out everything you need to know about Kristin here!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Kyle-Juszczyk-Wife-SS-embed.jpg><h2>How did Kyle and Kristin meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Both Kyle and Kristin went to college in New England early in their young adulthoods, but it wasn’t until they were in Maryland that they met. Kyle was a player for the Harvard Crimson, while Kristin was a student at University of Rhode Island, but she later transferred to Towson University in Baltimore. Kyle’s NFL career actually began with the Ravens, and so the two met while Kristin was living in Baltimore, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Niner’s Nation.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>They’ve been married since July 2019</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The couple got married in a beautiful ceremony at the Cedar Lakes Estate in New York. Both Kyle and Kristin celebrated their beautiful ceremony with loving posts on their respective <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagrams</a>. The 49ers star wrote a sweet post, celebrating their marriage. “I married the most beautiful bride inside and out!! Not a day that I’m with you will go by that I don’t kiss you. This was the best weekend of my life! I never wanted it to end!” he wrote about their wedding on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><h2>Kristin was a real estate agent before Kyle signed to the 49ers</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>After graduating from Towson, Kristin began her career as a realtor, before making a switch once her husband made the move to the 49ers. She revealed that she decided not to continue working in real estate once they made the move, because she’d have to retake all the tests to get a new license in San Francisco. “I was really able to look myself in the mirror and be like, ‘Okay, what do you want to do? Do you want to go after real estate? Do you want to take this course all over again?'” she told&nbsp;Niner’s Nation.</p><h2>She owns an online boutique</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Deciding not to get a new real estate license, Kristin decided to pursue something new. She actually studied fashion while at URI, and she decided to open her own online boutique, called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Origin</a> in 2018. “ORIGIN’s goal is to capture the perfect mixture between femininity and streetwear. We offer a range of versatile pieces that enhance your individuality,” the website’s description says.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Origin features a wide array of different clothing, including dresses, tops, pants, and much more. Kristin often shows off her amazing fashion sense, and how she customizes and creates her own clothes on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “You’re going for that signature piece that people ask, ‘Oh my god, where did you get that? That’s so unique.’ That was the overall brand I wanted,” she said about the brand to&nbsp;Niner’s Nation.</p><h2>Kyle and Kristin are dog parents</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>While the Juszczyks don’t have kids of their own, they do have an adorable puppy named Mozzi (short for Mozzarella). The couple often share <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of themselves cuddling with their fluffy white dog, who they got in 2020. Kyle shared a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of himself in the pool with Mozzi in June 2020 and joked about “enjoying [his] first Father’s Day as a dog dad.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8qyo55lmqrAu6%2FZsqJmr5mbsm6Bj2prbmlmZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dj-akademiks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | DJ Akademiks net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-stephnie-weir-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Stephnie Weir Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
