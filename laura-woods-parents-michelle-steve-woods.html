and it was there she was compiling match reports for the student newspaper.</p><p>However, it wasn't long before fate intervened - landing Laura a stunning sporting opportunity - <a href=#>work experience</a>.</p><p>The presenter bagged the spot after she went <a href=#>travelling</a> and by chance met a fellow traveller who had spent time completing work experience at <a href=#>Sky Sports</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Laura Woods">Read More on Laura Woods</h2><p>Woods then got the contact details of the HR department&nbsp;and before she knew it she was offered a week's worth of work experience on <a href=#>Soccer AM</a>.</p><p>Following her stint at Soccer AM, Laura went on to climb the ranks at Sky - starting out as a runner before landing a job as an editorial assistant.</p><p>And it wasn't long before she swapped standing behind the camera for a role in front of one.</p><p>Since then&nbsp;Laura&nbsp;has trailblazed sports broadcasting with the likes of&nbsp;<a href=#>Gary Neville</a>, holding her own as the main presenter for <a href=#>talkSPORT's</a> breakfast show until June this year.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>Therefore, it comes as no surprise that <a href=#>she has amassed an impressive estimated £2 million</a> fortune - making her one of the wealthiest <a href=#>TV</a> hosts in the UK.</p><p>As of October 2023, Laura, who is also an <a href=#>Arsenal</a>&nbsp;supporter, has&nbsp;an impressive 740K followers&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;760.7K followers&nbsp;on <a href=#>X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p><h2>Who is Laura Woods' father, Steve Woods?</h2><p>Woods was born to parents Steve and Michelle.</p><p>The couple later split when Laura was young - with the presenter previously revealing that seeing them both in different relationships was ''unsettling''.</p><p>Like his daughter, Steve also enjoyed a career in the world of sport as a former English <a href=#>cricket</a> player.</p><h2>Who is Laura Woods' mother, Michelle Woods?</h2><p>Michelle Woods is the popular presenters mum - and she too had a shared love for sports.</p><p>During her career, Michelle coached <a href=#>rugby</a>.</p><p>Aside from this information, not much else is known about Woods' parents - with the pair appearing to prefer sport over the spotlight.</p><h2>Does Laura Woods have any siblings?</h2><p>Also part of the Woods brood are Laura's two older siblings - brothers Paul and Luke.</p><p>In September 2023, Woods previously spoke of her siblings and their connection to sport.</p><p>In an interview after she was named one of <a href=#>Karen Millen's 'Power Women'</a>, Laura told the brand: ''Passion for sport started for me when I was very very young.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"It was something my mum threw me and my brothers into all the time to get us out the house."</p><p>Similarly to their parents, not much else is known about Laura's siblings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH91gY9wamlqX6Gutr7AZq6op5SoerGt0Z6lratdoraktMSlo55lo6myt7GMsKaonKNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./woke-brecon-beacons-bosses-rebranding.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Woke bosses rebranding Brecon Beacons saying the name goes against green ideals</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dimpleplasty-plastic-surgery-millennial-beauty-trend-what-is-it-doctor-tips.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is The Millennial Beauty Trend Doctor Tips Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
