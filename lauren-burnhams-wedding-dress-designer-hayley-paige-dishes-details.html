Celebrity wedding dress designer <a href=#><strong>Hayley Paige</strong> </a>is creating a custom gown for <a href=#><strong>Lauren Burnham</strong></a> as her special day with <a href=#><strong>Arie Luyendyk Jr.</strong></a> nears.</p><p class=p1>“Her dress is kind of about happenstance and just really playing into a lot of the colors and the representations of what she’s been through emotionally,” Paige exclusively told <i>Stylish </i>on Wednesday, July 25. “I want to play with a lot of textures and colors and do a little bit of flashy details that do add to the happenstance of her personality. It definitely is a lot of fun to have a lot to work with and know that she’s not just expecting one element or something like that.”</p><p class=p1>The<a href=#> bridal expert</a>, who <a href=#>has collaborated</a> with Bachelor Nation fan favorites <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Andi Dorfman</strong></a>, is excited to weave Burnham’s personality into the dress.</p><p class=p1>“I think what’s great about Lauren is she kind of has this beauty about her that people are like, ‘Oh, she’s this bombshell, she has such a great figure and gorgeous hair.’ There’s a tendency for people to think that she’s this idealized person of perfection and that kind of leads, for me, into this temptation of balance,” Paige explained. “With design, I feel like it’s not so much about balance as it is about happenstance. It’s not about perfection, and I think with Lauren, meeting her and getting to know this warmhearted side of her, I want to really highlight the joy and just her personal style in this particular moment of her life.”</p><p class=p1>Burnham, 26, won Luyendyk Jr.’s heart during <i>The Bachelor </i>season 22. Although he proposed to winner<a href=#><strong> Becca Kufrin</strong></a>, he later made headlines for <a href=#>ending their engagement</a> in a televised breakup and rekindling his romance with Burnham. He <a href=#>popped the question</a> in March on the <i>After the Final Rose</i> special.</p><p class=p1>Paige revealed that Burnham’s <a href=#>controversial experience</a> on the ABC show was heavy on her heart during their recent bridal brainstorming session. “She actually teared up a bit, so I think that it’s a really special connection and moment where you’re so vulnerable and stripped down and there’s something very visceral about the wedding process,” Paige noted. “It all comes to life when you have the dress on and it becomes very real.”</p><p class=p1>Burnham and the race car driver, 36, are <a href=#>tying the knot</a> in January 2019 in Hawaii. They are “so in love,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told </a><i>Us Weekly </i>earlier this month. “Their relationship is stronger than it’s ever been and they’ve proved that Arie made the right choice.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While the nuptials may be six months away, Paige has already started designing Burnham’s dream dress. “What I really like is to not let her feel like I have full control. I think part of this process and doing something so custom is about listening to her as well,” Paige said of collaborating with the reality TV star. “I’m not really the kind of designer that’s, like, ‘I’ve got this. I’m gonna make it happen the way that I see fit.’ I think it is so important to be a really good listener. To be a good designer is to really be a good listener as well. Then, of course, trusting is part of the craft, putting the dress together and layering and things like that.”</p><p class=p1>As for Paige? The bridal guru recently launched her label’s size-inclusive line, a flower girl line and an app, Holy Matrimoji, to help women prepare to walk down the aisle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Gutr7Ep2SbraKjtaK50maunpyUnruoecOrnKyrXZmytLXGp5yrZZiWxq2x2GanmqGXmnqltdKhnKxllJrBorXLrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./arturo-vidal-asonia-isaza.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>My Pandita - Arturo Vidal gets romantic in front of 1990s Fiat Panda as he cuddles up to girlf</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kaycee-rice.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kaycee Rice Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
