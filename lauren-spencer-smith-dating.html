The <a href=#>Canadian singer</a> ended a bad relationship and has since coupled up with a guy who clearly makes her happy.</p><p>Who is this mystery guy? Here’s what we know about Lauren’s boyfriend.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lauren Spencer Smith is dating Matt Odell.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>The crooner is now coupled up with a guy named Matt, who she penned a song about and gushes over on social media. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post, Lauren dubbed Matt, “my favourite person on the [planet],” and also enthused that he is “the kindest most selfless guy I know.” She went on to express her gratitude for everything he does for her. In turn, Matt shared a lovey-dovey post about Lauren in honor of her birthday in September.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The singer has also praised her boyfriend on TikTok on many occasions, notably calling out <a href=#>his massage skills</a> in one post that boasted about how many times Matt has offered up this sweet treatment.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lauren wrote a song about her boyfriend, and a past boyfriend had something to do with the tune.</h2><p>The song “Flowers” sees Lauren comparing her attentive, loving boyfriend Matt with someone from her past who sounds like a jerk. As the American Idol alum shared in an interview with the radio station <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WRMF</a>, “It was kind of inspired by two things. Basically, my boyfriend now is like the best human being in the whole world."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She went on to share, "And in the beginning of our relationship, anything nice he did to me, I would just have this trauma response and, like, start crying, because I couldn’t handle that somebody was treating me right. Because I was treated so wrong [by my ex].”</p><p>As Lauren then explained, her ex was perpetually claiming he was going to bring her blooms, but he never did — unless he was trying to make up with her after a fight, which as fans will know, is something she sings about specifically in “Flowers.”</p><p>Meanwhile, not much is known about Matt, outside of him being a great boyfriend to Lauren! His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> does prove that Matt is also very close with his family. He wrote a post paying tribute to his grandmother who passed away, and he later confessed to his followers that, sadly, his mom had been diagnosed with terminal cancer (tragic news that inspired Matt to run a marathon).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa62vsSnZKyolaOwpr6MrKSirJhisaLAyKee</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paris-jackson-haircut-so-edgy-and-short.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paris Jackson Haircut: So Edgy (and Short)!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./corey-stoll-wife-nadia-bowers-welcome-first-child-see-the-family-pic-2015911.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Corey Stoll, Wife Nadia Bowers Welcome First Child: See the Family Pic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
