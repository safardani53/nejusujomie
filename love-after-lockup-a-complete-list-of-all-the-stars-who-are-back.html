lifelong battle against addiction.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, LAL Season 1 star Alla Subbotina lost her life to an overdose.</p><p>Perhaps it was inevitable that a show focusing on some of the most troubled and marginalized members of American society would feature so many tragic outcomes.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>There’s an argument to be made about whether the fame and influx of cash that comes from reality TV money is a good or bad thing in the lives of these extremely vulnerable men and women.</p><p>And obviously the answer to that question depends largely on each individual parolee and their situation.</p><p>It’s worth noting, however, that there’s a remarkable low recidivism rate among the Love After Lockup cast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In fact, as the Starcasm reported this week, the list of Season 1 and 2 cast members who have wound up back behind bars is remarkably short.</p><p>Take a look:</p><p><strong>Tony Wood, Season 1</strong>: Tony is likely one of the least sympathetic figures in the show’s history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>He repeatedly exploited and cheated on Angela, whose willingness to forgive and trust her pathologically disloyal partner earned a good deal of criticism from fans.</p><p>As you may recall, Tony’s first — and, remarkably, only! — post-prison arrest was documented on the show.</p><p>Tony was picked up for breaking his parole during his time on LAL, but somehow, he hasn’t been arrested since!</p><p>Of course, Angela says he recently skipped town with her car and $4,000 in cash, so he might not be a free man for much longer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Lizzie Kommes, Season 1:</strong> Lizzie was open about exploiting Scott and other men that she "met" behind bars, but she eventually decided to leave the sugar daddy life behind her, and she landed a stable factory job shortly thereafter.</p><p>Fans were overjoyed when she revealed that she had managed to beat the substance abuse issues that had caused the majority of her legal woes.</p><p>Unfortunately, that period of stability didn’t last very long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Though she’s not in jail at the moment, Lizzie was arrested several more times as a result of a tumultuous relationship.</p><p>She also admitted that she had lied to fans about getting sober.</p><p>Here’s hoping she can get back on the right path soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Other than Alla, who was unfortunately arrested numerous times as a result of her fatal battle with substance abuse, the rest of the Season 1 cast have all managed to stay out of jail!</p><p>So congratulations are in order for&nbsp;Garrett Tanner, Lamar Jackson (the Los Angeles resident, not the Baltimore Ravens quarterback), and&nbsp;Dominic Dalla Nora who is still married to wife Mary.</p><p>In fact, the couple recently announced that Mary is pregnant with the couple’s second child!</p><p>Unfortunately, the Season 2 cast hasn’t fared quite as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Michael Simmons, Season 2: </strong>Somehow, despite all the time he devoted to impregnating every woman east of the Mississippi, Michael was also able to find a place in his busy for his true love — petty crime.</p><p>He was arrested for felony drug possession in 2018, and as Starcasm notes, that brush with the law was side-stepped by producers, even though it happened while he was filming the show.</p><p>Simmons was later picked up in Florida for felony child neglect, but amazingly, he’s currently out of jail and off parole! Progress!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Clint Brady, Season 2:</strong> Clint — whose divorce from Trace Wagaman was finalized just weeks before her death — wasn’t even one of the convicts on the show, but he’s still got quite a rap sheet.</p><p>He’s been picked up for DWI several times, including one incident in which he crashed into a bunch of storage units and a freakin’ boat while hauling a trailer of Little Debby snack cakes!</p><p>Brady has been arrested several times since he began appearing on the show, but most of them were marijuana busts that did not result in any jail time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Matt Frasier, Season 2: </strong>And now we come to the man who has managed to rack up more arrests than anyone else in the illustrious history of Love After Lockup!</p><p>Matt Frasier’s relationship with the eternally-optimistic Caitlin didn’t last very long, and she probably wasn’t surprised to learn that her ex is currently serving 37 years behind bars on a number of charges, several of which are related to violent crime.</p><p>Frasier was recently arrested following a home invasion in which he pointed a gun at a mother and son while his partners ransacked the place.</p><p>We don’t think he’ll be appearing on future seasons anytime soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So yeah, the Season 2 cast has seen some dark times, but it’s also the season that brought us the show’s greatest success story:</p><p>Brittany and Marcelino have welcomed two children together, and they recently purchased a&nbsp;$425,000 2,791 square foot house near Las Vegas!</p><p>The success story is particularly impressive given Brittany’s horrific childhood and early adulthood!</p><p>We look forward to seeing more of these two on future seasons of Life After Lockup!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation"
