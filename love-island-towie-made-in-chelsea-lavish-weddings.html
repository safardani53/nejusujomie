who wore an Enzonai fishtail wedding dress - sat on golden thrones at their own private table, while guests tucked into seared scallops and beef wellington.</p><p>Meanwhile, their first dance song, <a href=#>John Legend</a>’s You & I, was performed by former <a href=#>X Factor</a> runner-up <a href=#>Rebecca Ferguson</a>, who also gave guests a rendition of her hit Nothing’s Real But Love.</p><p>The evening party saw many more guests arrive, including Love Island voiceover star <a href=#>Iain Stirling</a>, and they were treated to booze served by pop-up prosecco and Peroni vans -
