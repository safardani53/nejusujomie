However, Short departed from the&nbsp;sketch comedy show after working for a single season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite Short's&nbsp;premature departure, he&nbsp;is credited for his contribution&nbsp;in&nbsp;reviving&nbsp;the show's fanbase,&nbsp;which once came to a stand-still after the departure of the now-legendary actor and comedian, Eddie Murphy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Martin Short's Career in Movies and Television</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Apart from comedy-based shows, Short, 71, has made a long career in movies and television shows. His movie career started in the year 1979 after he was offered a part in the movie Lost and Found.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The versatile actor is not only known for his acting skills, but he is also notable for his voice acting, which began in 1993 with the animated movie We're Back!&nbsp;A Dinosaur's Story.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Short&nbsp;later lent his voice to&nbsp;many other movies, including Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted and the 2020 movie The Willoughbys. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>During his&nbsp;glittering career, the versatile actor worked on television shows such as 1972's youth television series&nbsp;Right On, The Tracy Ullman Show, and his sitcom series titled The Martin Short Show.</p><p>In the latter show,&nbsp;Short&nbsp;was credited as a&nbsp;creator, writer, and executive producer.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Short&nbsp;is still active in his career and was last seen in Hulu's mystery-comedy&nbsp;series called <a href=# rel=follow>Only Murders in the Building</a> alongside Steve Martin and popular singer/actor <a href=# rel=follow>Selena Gomez</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Martin Short Lost Wife Nancy Dolman to Cancer</h2><p>In 2010, millions of hearts were broken when&nbsp;fans and well-wishers of&nbsp;Short came to know of Dolman's passing. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">As per People</a>, Short's wife was suffering from ovarian cancer, diagnosed in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>After battling cancer for three years, Dolman died at the age of 58, leaving her husband and three children&nbsp;— Katherine, Oliver, and Henry&nbsp;— behind. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During her treatment, Dolman was kept under the care of a private physician whose expertise was helping people with natural diseases.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Short Still Communicates With Wife Dolman</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>It might come as a surprise to many, but during his 2019's interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">AARP</a>, the actor firstly called his marriage with his late wife, which lasted for almost thirty years, to be a triumph and later revealed that he still communicates with her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He further explained the meaning behind his claim. As per Short, despite Dolman's&nbsp;death, he&nbsp;maintains&nbsp;his late wife to be an active family member and involves her in his soliloquy.&nbsp;</p><p>Short explained the situation by saying,&nbsp;</p><p>It’s “Hey, Nan,” you know? How would she react to this decision or that, especially regarding our three kids.</p><p>Short further spoke about how he believes in the idea that when people die, they "zoom into the people that love them," and spoke strongly about how it was wrong to never talk about them after their demise.&nbsp;</p><p>"This idea that it just ends, and&nbsp;don't speak of them&nbsp;— that's wrong," Short continued. He called the practice to be based on "denial" of the fact that no one remains immortal. To actor Short, "she's still here."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRp8Gquoysn6iqpGLEqrLEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./colton-dixon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Colton Dixon Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-plawecki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin Plawecki [2023 Update]: Early Life, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
