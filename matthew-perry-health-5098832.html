However, he used his experiences to help others in similar situations.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“The best thing about me, bar none, is that if somebody comes to me and says, ‘I can’t stop drinking, can you help me?’ I can say ‘yes’ and follow up and do it,” the actor said during a podcast <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview</a> with <strong>Tom Power</strong> in 2022. “When I die … I want that to be the first thing that’s mentioned. And I’m gonna live the rest of my life proving that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Keep reading to learn more about his drug and alcohol abuse, his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>recovery journey</a>, and how he was doing before his death.</p><h2>What Did Matthew Perry Say About Addiction?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Nearly three decades ago in 1997, Matthew suffered from a jet ski accident and soon became addicted to Vicodin, a Narcotic drug known to treat pain. After the accident, his Vicodin addiction led to abusing alcohol, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>, and he checked himself into rehab in Minnesota that year. Despite his attempts to get sober, Matthew was only able to stay sober for a short period of time before he would relapse again.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Three years after he went to rehab for the first time, Matthew was hospitalized in 2000 for alcohol-related pancreatitis, according to the same outlet. After his two-week hospitalization, Matthew later began “detoxing” on the set of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Friends</a>, with a notably different physical appearance in seasons 6 and 7. The popular TV star would eventually break his sobriety multiple times and go to rehab over 15 times throughout his journey.</p><h2>What Has He Said About His Recovery?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>It was not until 2002, that he spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times </a>about his struggle and admitted he needed help.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“When [fame] happens, it’s kind of like Disneyland for a while. For me it lasted about eight months, this feeling of ‘I’ve made it, I’m thrilled, there’s no problem in the world.’ And then you realize that it doesn’t accomplish anything, it’s certainly not filling any holes in your life,” Matthew told the outlet, one year after getting sober again. “I didn’t get sober because I felt like it. I got sober because I was worried I was going to die the next day.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Matthew would also battle alcohol abuse throughout his life. He said he began drinking alcohol at 14 years old and soon began drinking “every day” by age 18, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC News</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>”I had this odd rule that I would never drink on a set,” the 17 Again star said. “But I went to work in extreme cases of hangover. It’s so&nbsp;horrible to feel that way and have to work and be funny on top of that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Matthew would spend the next two decades of his life in and out of rehab facilities.</p><h2>How Long Was Matthew Perry Sober?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>He became sober in 2021, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>, just months before he filmed the viral&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Friends Reunion</a>&nbsp;HBO Max special. He said he was still sober in his 2022 book, explaining, “My therapist said, ‘The next time you think about taking Oxycontin, just think about having a colostomy bag for the rest of your life … And a little window opened and I crawled through it and I no longer want Oxycontin anymore.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Prior to that, in 2018, Matthew was hospitalized for three months for a gastrointestinal perforation. He took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> at the time to announce the difficult moment in a humorous way. “Three months in a hospital bed. Check,” he wrote at the time.</p><h2>How Was Matthew Perry Doing Before His Death?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-18>In November 2022, he appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The View</a>&nbsp;and told co-host&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Whoopi Goldberg </strong></a>that he was “doing really well” and that his life was “going great.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Around the same time, Matthew appeared in a<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> candid interview</a> with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a> and told her all about his struggles while promoting the memoir. He detailed that he was once taking 55 Vicodin pills per day, was once in a coma for two weeks, and had over 14 surgeries.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>“One of the things I have to deal with is that my family rushed to the hospital and were told that I have a 2 percent chance to make it through the night,” he told the reporter at the time. “And, you know, my mom heard that, and my dad heard that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>At the time, Matthew said he was on the “winning side” mentality in his recovery journey. “I’ve surrendered, but to the winning side, not the losing,” he penned in his book. “I’m no longer mired in an impossible battle with drugs and alcohol.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Following his untimely death, TMZ reported that the toxicology report for Matthew revealed that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he died from</a> the “acute effects of ketamine.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-23><i>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, contact the&nbsp;</i><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline</i></a><i>&nbsp;at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yaq62glax6sbHRq7BmoJWWubW0jG5ncnBoaH9w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-osman-khalid-butt-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Osman Khalid Butt Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./history-origins-everyday-household-items-adam-kay-book.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>From loo roll to TV &amp;amp; coming up with the toothbrush in prison, how everyday items were invented reve</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
