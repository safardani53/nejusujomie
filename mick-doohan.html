He made his Grand Prix debut for Honda on an NSR 500 cc two-stroke motorcycle in 1989.</p><p>Late in the 1990 season, Doohan claimed his first victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix on his way to third in the championship.</p><p>In 1991, he was paired with his fellow Australian Wayne Gardner on a Honda RVF750 superbike and won the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race.</p><p>He competed successfully throughout the early 1990s and appeared to be on his way to winning his first world championship when he was seriously injured in a practice crash before the 1992 Dutch TT.</p><p>He suffered permanent and serious damage to his right leg due to medical complications and, at one stage, faced amputation of the leg.</p><p>At the time, Doohan was 65 points in the lead of the championship, but could not compete for eight weeks after the crash.</p><p>After an arduous recovery, he returned to racing for the final two races but could not prevent Yamaha rider Wayne Rainey from winning his third consecutive title (by four points from Doohan).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rise_to_Celebrity></span><strong>Rise to Celebrity</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1993 he struggled with the healing of his leg and the ability to race the Honda at an elite level, stating later that in that year it was all he could do to just keep his ride at Honda.</p><p>It was also during this time he switched to a left thumb-operated rear brake, as his right foot is no longer able to perform this function.</p><p>In 1994 however, he won his first 500 cc World Championship. Thereafter, until 1998, he dominated the class, winning five consecutive 500 cc World Championships.</p><p>In 1997, his most successful year, Doohan won 12 out of 15 races, finished second in another two, and crashed out of the final race of the season at his home GP while leading by more than six seconds.</p><p>In June 1996, Doohan was inducted as a Member of the Order of Australia for his contribution to the sport of motor racing.</p><p>Despite up to eight rivals on non-factory HRC Honda motorcycles Doohan’s margin of superiority over them was such that in many races Doohan would build a comfortable lead and then ride well within his limits to cruise to victory.</p><p>Although pure riding skill played a large part in his success, the ability of his chief race engineer, Jeremy Burgess, to perfect the suspension and geometry of a racing motorcycle may have given him an advantage over his rivals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=End_of_His_Journey></span>End of His Journey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Between 1994 and 1998 the bike was said not to have had many changes, with Honda engineers reportedly becoming frustrated at Doohan’s reluctance to try innovations.</strong></p><p>Such as electronic shifting (it was only when Rossi came to Honda in 2000 that Honda engineers had their head with Rossi willing to try more innovations).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mick-Doohan-Motorcycle-racer-racer.jpg><p>One notable trait of Doohan’s post-crash riding style was the use of a thumb-operated rear brake developed during 1993 owing to the reduced range of motion in his ankle.</p><p>This was operated by a “nudge” bar similar to a personal watercraft throttle but mounted on the left handlebar.</p><p>In 1999 Doohan had another accident, this time in a very wet qualifying session for the Spanish Grand Prix.</p><p>He again broke his leg in several places and subsequently announced his retirement. Jeremy Burgess, Doohan’s chief engineer for his entire career, later became Valentino Rossi’s chief engineer.</p><p>After Doohan retired he went to work as a roving adviser to Honda’s Grand Prix race effort. After the 2004 season, Doohan and Honda parted company.</p><p>In June 2011, Doohan made an appearance at the Isle of Man TT. Doohan completed a parade lap and was most enamored by the thrill and spectacle of the Snaefell Mountain Course.</p><p>He then went on to pay tribute to his former Honda racing teammate, Joey Dunlop.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#>Who is Lando Norris?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mick_Doohan_Personal_Life></span>Mick Doohan Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Mick Doohan is married.
