His father, Michael, was a former NFL player and coach.</p><p>On the other hand, his mother, Ann, was a homemaker. Aside from that, there are no indications that Mike has a sibling.</p><p>Zimmer was into football from a very young age, as his father was involved in the sport.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>For his primary education, Mike attended the Lockport Township High School in Lockport, Illinois.</p><p>There, he was one of the star players in multiple sports. To illustrate, Zimmer earned all-conference honors in baseball, wrestling, and football (1972-73).</p><p>After graduation, he went to Illinois State University, where he played as a quarterback in 1974. But, sadly, Mike broke his thumb and had to move to the linebacker position in 1976.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IIIinois-State-Alum-Mike-Zimmer.jpg></p><p>And, if that wasn’t enough, Zimmer’s career ended prematurely the same year due to a neck injury.</p><p>Nonetheless, he didn’t lose hope and switched his focus to coaching. Later on, Mike graduated with a degree in Physical Education.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Following a premature end to his playing career, Mike took up the coaching role. Zimmer’s love for the game was too strong for him to give it up.</p><p>Mike’s first coaching job was at the University of Missouri from 1979-1980. There, he worked as a part-time defensive assistant. After that, Zimmer coached at Weber State College for eight years serving in several roles.</p><p>Then, from 1989-1993, he worked as the defensive back and defensive coordinator for the Washington State Cougars.</p><p>Thus, after 14 years of grafting in college football, Mike got his first crack at NFL with the Dallas Cowboys in 1994.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Mike-Zimmer-Source-New-York-Post-scaled.webp></p><p>Zimmer stayed with the franchise until 2006. Most notably, Mike won Super Bowl XXX in 1995 during his 12-year stay in Dallas.</p><p>In 2007, the Illinois native joined the Atlanta Falcons before moving to the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>Zimmer served as the defensive coordinator for the Bengals from 2008-2013. Subsequently, he moved to the Minnesota Vikings as their head coach in 2014.</p><p>Since then, Mike has guided his team to two NFC North Championships in 2015 and 2017.</p><h3>After 2018</h3><p>For 2018, the professional football coach continued working with the Vikings. He also became the fourth head coach in Minnesota Vikings history to get 40 wins.</p><p>Similarly, in 2019, Zimmer became the third coach to surpass 52 franchise wins. After that, in July 2020, he signed a three-year (until 2023) contract extension with the Vikings.</p><p>On January 10, 2022, Zimmer was fired from his eight-year tenure and ended with a 74–59–1 (.556) record, including a 2–3 (.400) playoff record in eight seasons as a head coach with the Vikings.</p><p>According to the reports, in the end, months of 2022, Mike Zimmer accepted a position as an analyst on Jackson State head coach Deion Sanders’ staff.</p><h2>How Old Is Mike Zimmer? Age, Height & Nationality</h2><p>Being born in 1956 makes Zimmer’s age 67 at the moment.</p><p>His star sign is Gemini. People who fall under Gemini’s sign tend to be adaptable, outgoing, and intelligent.</p><p>Talking about his height, Mike has decided to keep it a secret for now. Similarly, the intel on his weight also remains a mystery. And, about his nationality, the&nbsp;67-year-old is an American.</p><h3>Mike Zimmer Eye</h3><p>Per reports, Mike scratched his eye during the game between the Bears and the Vikings on Halloween in 2017. Following this, he suffered a torn retina and had surgery in early November.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Mike-Zimmer-scaled.jpeg></p><p>However, the damage was permanent, as Zimmer lost most of his sight in the right eye. As a consequence, Mike has had to face a lot of difficulties.</p><h2>What Is Mike Zimmer’s Salary? Net Worth</h2><p>Mike earns a yearly salary of <strong>$4 million</strong> as the head coach of the Minnesota Vikings. Although it is a considerable sum, Zimmer is one of the lowest-paid coaches in the NFL.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the man who commands the biggest paycheck is New England Patriots head coach <a href=# rel=noopener>Bill Belichick</a>.</p><p>During his two decades with the franchise, Belichick has won the Super Bowl an incredible six times.</p><p>Mike’s net worth is <strong>$12 million</strong> as of 2023. He has been working professionally since 1979. Hence, his massive bank balance should come as no surprise.</p><p>Sadly there is not much information on Mike’s house and his car’s brands. Zimmer owns a hunting lodge in Northern Kentucky. Likewise, the professional coach had set up the office for the 2020 NFL Draft at his own home.</p><h2>Achievements & Awards</h2><ul><li>Super Bowl champion (XXX)</li><li>NFL Assistant Coach of the Year (2009)</li><li>George Halas Award (2010)</li></ul><h2>Coaching Stats</h2><table class=sortable><tr><th class=dt-left>Season</th><th class=dt-left>League</th><th class=dt-left>Team</th><th class=dt-right>G</th><th class=dt-right>W</th><th class=dt-right>L</th><th class=dt-right>T</th><th class=dt-right>Win%</th><th class=dt-right>G</th><th class=dt-right>W</th><th class=dt-right>L</th><th class=dt-right>Win%</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class=dt-left><strong>2014</strong></td><td class=dt-left>NFL</td><td class=dt-left>Minnesota Vikings</td><td class=dt-right>16</td><td class=dt-right>7</td><td class=dt-right>9</td><td class=dt-right>0</td><td class=dt-right>.438</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=dt-left><strong>2015</strong></td><td class=dt-left>NFL</td><td class=dt-left>Minnesota Vikings</td><td class=dt-right>16</td><td class=dt-right>11</td><td class=dt-right>5</td><td class=dt-right>0</td><td class=dt-right>.688</td><td class=dt-right>1</td><td class=dt-right>0</td><td class=dt-right>1</td><td class=dt-right>.000</td></tr><tr><td class=dt-left><strong>2016</strong></td><td class=dt-left>NFL</td><td class=dt-left>Minnesota Vikings</td><td class=dt-right>16</td><td class=dt-right>8</td><td class=dt-right>8</td><td class=dt-right>0</td><td class=dt-right>.500</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=dt-left><strong>2017</strong></td><td class=dt-left>NFL</td><td class=dt-left>Minnesota Vikings</td><td class=dt-right>16</td><td class=dt-right>13</td><td class=dt-right>3</td><td class=dt-right>0</td><td class=dt-right>.813</td><td class=dt-right>2</td><td class=dt-right>1</td><td class=dt-right>1</td><td class=dt-right>.500</td></tr><tr><td class=dt-left><strong>2018</strong></td><td class=dt-left>NFL</td><td class=dt-left>Minnesota Vikings</td><td class=dt-right>16</td><td class=dt-right>8</td><td class=dt-right>7</td><td class=dt-right>1</td><td class=dt-right>.531</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=dt-left><strong>2019</strong></td><td class=dt-left>NFL</td><td class=dt-left>Minnesota Vikings</td><td class=dt-right>16</td><td class=dt-right>10</td><td class=dt-right>6</td><td class=dt-right>0</td><td class=dt-right>.625</td><td class=dt-right>2</td><td class=dt-right>1</td><td class=dt-right>1</td><td class=dt-right>.500</td></tr><tr><td class=dt-left><strong>2020</strong></td><td class=dt-left>NFL</td><td class=dt-left>Minnesota Vikings</td><td class=dt-right>16</td><td class=dt-right>7</td><td class=dt-right>9</td><td class=dt-right>0</td><td class=dt-right>.438</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><tr><td class=dt-left><strong>Totals</strong></td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>&nbsp;</td><td class=dt-right>112</td><td class=dt-right>64</td><td class=dt-right>47</td><td class=dt-right>1</td><td class=dt-right>.576</td><td class=dt-right>5</td><td class=dt-right>2</td><td class=dt-right>3</td><td class=dt-right>.400</td></tr></table><h3>Mike Zimmer’s Contract</h3><p>In February 2019, the Vikings extended Zimmer’s contract by one year.
