My drinking really started to kick off.</p><p>“My beloved boys started to see a mum that used to be at home all the time, going out regularly on a Friday night, getting very drunk, often bringing people back from the pub or staying out to party.</p><p>“I was selfish and didn’t put them first. What I didn’t realise at the time was that I was in the throes of alcoholism.”</p><p>Lisa admits the boozing took its toll on her relationship with her sons - and the eldest moved out in 2004 to live with his dad, which “broke her heart”.</p><p>“My youngest stayed with me but as my drinking progressed our relationship got harder,” Lisa admits.</p><p>“They had an alcoholic parent who was a mess but I just thought I liked a drink - I was in denial.”</p><p>It took me years to face up to my illness</p><span class=quote-credit>Lisa Baker</span><p>She then met a new man through mutual friends in 2004 and they drank alcohol together whenever they saw each other.</p><p>After six years together, Lisa gave away all of her belongings and furniture to move into his house.</p><p>Lisa said: “My relationship was volatile and toxic.&nbsp;</p><p>“I gave up my home with my son Joe and was making such bad decisions. After six weeks of living together, a terrible fight broke out and we had to leave with nothing.</p><p>“I reached a real low. Everything I had worked for had all gone. My drinking was spiralling as I was renting a flat I hated, Joe didn’t like it either, and my other son didn’t want to live with me.</p><p>“Things were going from bad to worse. I started drinking wine in the morning - and would drink until I blacked out in the evening.”</p><p>Lisa’s boozing also started to overlap with her working day.&nbsp;</p><p>She admits that she began to join a grieving colleague for wine at work - which at the time she thought was “brilliant”.</p><p>Once a week, Lisa would have to travel to Victoria, London, for a meeting with her boss.&nbsp;</p><p>On her way in she would head to the off-licence at the station to buy a mini bottle of wine, head to the toilets and neck it, before hiding the empty bottle in the sanitary bin.</p><p>“I would drink that bottle like I was doing a shot of booze, then throw it in the bin,” she says.</p><p>“Jack was still living at his dad’s while Joe was living with friends at this point. So I would wake up, drink wine and then run to the toilet and throw up.</p><p>They had an alcoholic parent who was a mess but I just thought I liked a drink</p><span class=quote-credit>Lisa Baker</span><p>“Once this first drink was in my system I would have to chase the booze all day long, drinking, passing out, drinking, passing out, repeat.</p><p>“I was really worrying everyone. My mum would jump on a coach from Bognor Regis and travel to help me, but she couldn’t do anything as I was hooked.</p><p>“My eldest son had to leave his job one day because I wasn’t answering my phone to anybody.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was out cold-drunk at 9am and he had to climb a drain pipe to get into my flat.”</p><p>During her lowest moments, Lisa’s best friend had to keep coming over to check if she was “dead or alive” as she was uncontactable.</p><p>She even overdosed on pills one morning as a cry for help and her friend sat with her in St Helier’s hospital all day before she was discharged - but it didn’t stop her drinking.</p><p>Then drunk in the local high street one morning, Lisa bumped into one of her son’s friends - it was to be the catalyst she needed to face her addiction.</p><p>Lisa said: “Things were at their worst and my mum said I should go and stay with her in Bognor Regis for a while to get better.</p><p>“But the day before, I went on a massive wine bender for hours until my son’s friend found me wandering the high street.</p><p>“This man used to come to my house for tea as a little boy and he was shocked and horrified to see me in this state.</p><p>“The following morning, I had the moment of clarity every alcoholic needs when my son Jack looked me straight in the eye and said, ‘you have involved my friends now.’&nbsp;</p><p>“‘If you don’t stop drinking, I’m done with you for good’.</p><p>“I never drank again after that day - 1st September 2010. My best friend acted as my bodyguard the whole day so I wouldn’t go to the shop for booze when every fibre of my body was craving it.</p><p>“Driving up to Bognor the next day as a 42-year-old woman moving back to the box room at her mum’s, it hit me what had happened to me.</p><p>“Mum took me to a self-help group the following day. I’d previously tried to get help in London but wasn’t ready to quit.</p><p>“Now, something had changed and I wanted to save myself from the alcoholism that was killing me.”</p><p>It wasn’t an easy journey. But this time, Lisa stuck at it.</p><p>I went on a massive wine bender for hours until my son’s friend found me wandering the high street</p><span class=quote-credit>Lisa Baker</span><p>She did everything suggested to get sober and completed a 12 steps programme. And, in September she celebrated 12 years of sobriety.</p><p>She’s since had two jobs in sobriety and now works as a support worker for women and children in the court system after going to university to study counselling.</p><p>Lisa also joined <a href=# aria-label="TikTok (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> to help others going through a similar situation.</p><p>Lisa said: “The more I worked on my sobriety, the more I liked it so I made friends and moved to the coast</p><p>“During Covid, I joined TikTok and started sharing videos about how I got sober and how good my life is today. So many strangers reached out to me as they felt alone, isolated and like nobody understands them.</p><p>“I didn’t realise what the real Lisa wanted, needed or liked. My drinking habits controlled me.&nbsp;</p><p>“But I finally quit for me, my physical and mental health, but also for my sons.</p><p>“Now I will leave a legacy for my grandchildren who have never seen their nanny drunk and never will.
