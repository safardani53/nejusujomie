Because once he’s done with you, he is gonna come after me and I’m not f—king having it. So, I’m sorry, Matty, you gotta go.’ Serves him right!”</p><p>Earlier this year, the 1975 frontman made headlines when he weighed in on Noel’s feud with brother <strong>Liam Gallagher</strong>. After Healy said the siblings <a href=#>should set aside their decade-long estrangement to reunite</a> Oasis, Noel put the U.K. native on blast.</p><p>“He needs to go over how s—t his band is and split up,” Noel, who left Oasis in 2009, told Spin in May before <a href=#>calling Healy a “slack-jawed f—kwit.”</a></p><p>That same month, the Grammy nominee <a href=#>sparked romance rumors with Swift</a>, 33, following her split from longtime partner <a href=#><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>. Healy was seen at several of the “Mastermind” singer’s <a href=#>Eras Tour concerts in Nashville and Philadelphia</a>.</p><p>Swift, who was briefly linked to Healy in 2014, <a href=#>didn’t publicly comment on the dating speculation</a> but hinted at a positive development in her personal life during a performance in Boston last month.</p><p>“I kind of feel like telling you, I don’t know, I’ve just never been this happy in my life in all aspects of my life ever before,” she gushed to concertgoers. “And I just want to thank you for being a part of that. It’s not just the tour. I just sort of feel like my life finally feels like it makes sense.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed earlier this month that Swift and Healy <a href=#>pulled the plug on their romance</a>. “Taylor and Matt are no longer romantically involved,” a source exclusively told Us hours before the British singer t<a href=#>ook the stage on his own overseas tour</a>. “They had fun together, but it was never serious.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, a second source revealed that Swift’s friends <a href=#>were “not surprised” that her connection with Healy</a> didn’t last, adding, “She wasn’t ready for another serious relationship just yet.”</p><p>Healy seemingly <a href=#>addressed the breakup during a concert</a> in Vienna, telling the crowd earlier this month: “[People] in the front had some very beautiful signs that said, ‘You are loved.’ That was very, very kind. I’m sure that it’s alluding to … as you’re aware, I’m not very online at the moment, and I’m sure people have just been calling me a c–t relentlessly. Honestly, as much as I appreciate that, it’s so beautiful and I thank you, but I don’t need it. Because I’ve got them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanp5Wheqity6WYoKCVp3q1rcqeqmabopqxqsCMn6arZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqXqurdOtsGaglZa5ur%2BMrKeloaRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./angela-goethals-19770520-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Angela Goethals (Movie Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-wahlberg-prays-for-troubled-actor-lane-garrison.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Wahlberg Prays for Troubled Actor Lane Garrison</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
