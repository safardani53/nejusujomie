be out at 7.30pm but then not releasing them until much later.</p><p>The record, his fourth studio album, will be called Last Night In The Bittersweet.</p><p>It has been described as a 70-minute epic spanning “from classic rock to post-punk”.</p><p>His first two singles, called Lose It and Through The Echoes, give fans an ample taste of what to expect from the record.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Paolo Nutini">Read more on Paolo Nutini</h2><p>But they could barely be more different from each other, suggesting it will be his most eclectic album to date — and quite the departure from the sound he became known for on his first three albums.</p><p>The delay to the releases was believed to be due to Paolo making sure he was 100 per cent happy with the tracks, which have been years in the making.</p><p>A source said: “Paolo has spent so long working on this new music that he has been extra hands-on in making sure everything is completely perfect.</p><p>“He cares so much about the songs and wants to give his fans, who have waited years for new music, the best experience possible.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>“Paolo was insistent that only a handful of people in his inner circle listened to the songs before they were released.</p><p>“And hardly anyone has heard the album yet.</p><p>“He is a very private person and wasn’t going to risk anything leaking at the last moment.</p><p>“Things have been kept under lock and key for months but now he is finally ready to release it.”</p><p>He first shot to fame in 2006 with his love song Last Request and went on to have hits including Jenny Don’t Be Hasty, Pencil Full Of Lead and Scream (Funk My Life Up).</p><p>But his gravelly voice hasn’t been heard for years, as he hasn’t performed — and has barely been seen — since going on hiatus in 2017.</p><p>He will return to the stage this Saturday with a performance at the 900-capacity Leadmill in Sheffield, followed by further intimate shows at central London’s 100 Club and Corran Halls in Oban in his native Scotland.</p><p>Tickets for those shows sold out in seconds earlier this week but he will also play a string of festivals this summer.</p><p>As one of the nation’s best singer-songwriters, it’s good to have him back.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center

Hits Radio breakfast show yesterday: “I’m trying to cover and protect my modesty as I’m getting out of the car.</p><p>“I lose my footing, fall to the ground on to my knees, my heel breaks and I hear a collective gasp from the crowd.</p><p>“Miraculously, I got up, I had no cuts, no grazes on my knees. The heel was broken but I still managed to walk on it somehow. It was terrible.</p><p>“I ended up wearing these shoes that belonged to the hotel manager of the venue, one size smaller than my own, and now I don’t actually know where my broken heel is.</p><p>“It’s somewhere in Manchester.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center id=bella-yella-for-fella>BELLA YELLA FOR FELLA</h2><p><a href=#>BELLA HADID</a> looks ready for summer in this yellow top and shades.</p><p>The model wore the cleavage-baring top and PVC trousers for a date night in New York with her art director boyfriend Marc Kalman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SPL5309250_016_Bella-Hadid-goes-out-for-her-boyfriend-Marcs-birthdayjpg-JS732042272.jpg><p>The duo have been seeing each other for almost two years, though they managed to keep the romance under wraps for several months — one of the few benefits of the pandemic. Now their every move is being caught by snappers.</p><p>Earlier this month Marc joined her at a Met Gala after-party, but he wasn’t there when she “blacked out”.</p><p>Clarifying an article this week that said it was caused by her tight corset, Bella wrote on Instagram: “My corset fit perfectly, with enough room to eat and drink.”</p><p>I’m not sure I’d even fit in a corset, let alone be able to eat and drink in one.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center id=charli-s-to-italy-in-to-george>CHARLI’S TO-ITALY IN TO GEORGE</h2><p><a href=#>CHARLI XCX</a> has confirmed her romance with The 1975’s <a href=#>George Daniel</a> as they jetted off on a romantic holiday together.</p><p>The Used To Know Me singer shared photos on Instagram of them on the trip, which she said was “delicious”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GETTY_Celebrity-Sightings-In-New-York-City-March-04-2022_ENT_GYI1238929804jpg-JS716389503.jpg><p>They are believed to have flown to Italy for the getaway ahead of the European leg of her Crash world tour, which starts in Dublin tomorrow.</p><p>The couple first met when they worked on a song called Spinning, which was released last spring. Then they teamed up to make her album Crash, which was released in March.</p><p>George co-wrote and produced the title track and persuaded her to end the record with her song Twice. She explained: “George Daniel, who is very good with tracklisting, simply said, ‘You’re an idiot if you don’t put this song last’.”</p><p>Despite his less-than-charming language, they later grew close following the breakdown of her long- term relationship with video game producer Huck Kwong last year.</p><p>Now they are quite the power couple, with 22 Top 40 hits and five No1 albums between them.</p><p>But with The 1975 expected to return with even more new music this year, organising their diaries so they actually have time to see each other will be quite the mission.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center id=liam-blasts-woke-bands>LIAM BLASTS WOKE BANDS</h2><p>WE’VE had our differences over the years but I can totally get behind <a href=#>Liam Gallagher</a> on this one.</p><p>The former Oasis legend has blasted the idiotic woke brigade and says new musicians are too afraid to be hell-raisers for fear of being cancelled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/readingfestival249_20210830114010725-JS727460705.jpg><p>When asked about his thoughts on cancel culture, Liam said: “Who the f*** are these people cancelling you, anyway?</p><p>“Like, f*** off.

Bring it f***ing on, you f***ing squares!” Speaking on The 2 Johnnies Podcast, Liam also admitted he believed the shift in culture had left young rock stars too afraid to be controversial, as he was during his heyday.</p><p>He added: “No one is really blowing my mind, if I’m honest.</p><p>“I just think this world now — there’s a lot of people who are scared to say what they want to.&nbsp; They’d get cancelled.</p><p>“I’d hate to think I was the last rock star, because that’s just f***ing sad.</p><p>“I’ve got a problem with a lot of these bands today who go, ‘I’m an artist’.</p><p>“No you’re f***ing not.
