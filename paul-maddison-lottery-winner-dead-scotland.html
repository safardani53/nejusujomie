after the pair split the money equally.</p><p>He is understood to have died on November 28, just months after his wife Evelyn died aged 62.</p><p>The former double-glazing firm boss moved to Perth to enjoy a quieter life after landing his £11million share of the fortune.</p><p>But months later his marriage to his first wife Ruth fell apart after she left him for another man.</p><p>The dad-of-two moved into the luxury six-bedroom Lettertabor Lodge and hired Evelyn McGillivary to clean it.</p><p>The pair fell in love and married on a beach in Mauritius on Valentine's Day 1997.</p><p>Paul sold the lodge to a member of the Stagecoach family for £450,000 after forking out £10,000 fixing up the property.</p><p>The couple then bought 16th-century Robgill Tower near Dumfries for £650,000.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>They lived a reclusive lifestyle, rarely being seen by their neighbours.</p><p>Locals in the nearby village of Kirtlebridge previously said they had rarely seen the pair come out of the 40-acre estate.</p><p>Paul had also installed security cameras, remote-controlled gates and an intercom immediately after moving in.</p><p>In 2008, the couple sold the tower for £2.8million and moved back to the Perth area.</p><p>Evelyn, a former florist said the house had been too big for them and it was time to downsize.</p><p>She told the Record: "It has been a fabulous and very happy house but it has become too big for us.</p><p>"Sometimes we moved bedrooms just for a change but really it's time for the next part of the dream.</p><p>"We have done the big house thing.</p><p>"Now we want something more manageable.</p><p>"This house is lottery fantasy now.</p><p>"Maybe another winner will buy it."</p><p>Evelyn is understood to have died earlier this year following a health battle.</p><p>Publicity-shy Paul hit the headlines in 1999 after he sued a small laundrette over a tea-stained silk bedspread.</p><p>The lotto winner was seeking £953 in compensation after the dry cleaners didn't remove the stain and left it with a "pink tint".</p><p>But the shop argued staff had warned him efforts to remove the stain were done at his own risk given a lack of cleaning instructions for the bedspread.</p><p>It is unknown how this legal battle ended.</p><p>Earlier this year, joint winner Mark declined to say if he still spoke to Paul.</p><p>Mark still works for the double-glazing firm he worked for before the win and invested £2million in the company.</p><p>He was 32 when he split the £11million and spent some of his winnings on a home in Barbados and also bought his local football club in Hastings, East Sussex.</p><p>The 61-year-old said his secret to staying normal was that he kept working but he admitted there was things he might have done differently.</p><p>A Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service spokesperson said: "The Procurator Fiscal received a report in connection with the death of a 73-year-old man in Perth on 28 November 2023.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“Following investigation the Procurator Fiscal concluded that no further action was required.</p><p>"The family have been informed."</p><p class=postsid
