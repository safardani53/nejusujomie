Her insights on intimate relationships also helped her personal life and its navigation over the years. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her personal life with now husband, Kaseburg, started around the mid-2000s. In her 2015 piece for <a href=# rel="follow noopener">AARP</a>, she wrote they had been together for "more than nine years."</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Pepper Schwartz with her husband, Fred Kaseburg, in Iceland.</strong> (Photo: Pepper Schwartz/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The biggest revelation, and the main subject of the article, was about how she, along with many others, choose not to live together with their partners.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She included many couples' stories about living separately while also maintaining a healthy romantic bond. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Unless you count shared vacations or running back and forth between our two houses," she wrote of herself, who lived 40 minutes away from her husband in Seattle,&nbsp;"the two of us have never&nbsp;lived together."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She has always been someone who spent more time away from home than at home. This relationship did not change that.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Schwartz and Kaseburg got engaged&nbsp;around 2013, and until then, they had been living in their separate homes. But, engagement caused her friends to ask if they would start living together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And they wanted to live together, too. But they eventually decided to not change the existing dynamic.</p><p>"Working out how we would do that has proved dicey," the doctor wrote in her piece. They did not want to let go of their dream homes they built and find a new house to live together.</p><p>They also thought about how they would pass on the inheritance to their children.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Adding to these, Schwartz lived with an assistant, and Kaseburg did not like having a third party in the house with them. Her dogs, too, were a sticking point for cohabitation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The couple eventually got married, and as her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bio</a> on her site suggests, they now live on a horse range outside of Seattle. Whether they live together now, we're not sure.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Pepper Schwartz’s Previous Relationships</h2><p>Schwartz's marriage to Kaseburg isn't her first one.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She has been married twice before, and they were both of similar nature to her now-marriage — a "peer marriage."&nbsp;The doctor has always believed in the marriage of the equals. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an August 1994 piece in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Seattle Times</a>, Carey Wual Gelernter detailed her life with ex husband Art Skolnik. It also mentioned how her first marriage had fallen apart.</p><p>Her marriage to her first husband ended because, according to her, they weren't living in the same place. They also did not make necessary commitments and "ego-taming" for it to work.</p><p>As for her marriage with Skolnik, an architect-planner, both of them were career-driven people. Neither sacrificed work time in favor of family time, but they always made time for both.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When the piece came out, they had been married for 12 years and had lived together for two years before that. Their children, son Cooper and daughter Ryder, were nine and 11 years old.</p><p>They were always busy and out of the home. So, weekdays were for socializing, and weekends were solely for family and friends. They took family vacations together, but most of their time was spent working.</p><p>In all of this, they led separate financial lives. They had separate accounts and liked the freedom that gave them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKiVpb2mvoysmqGvkafBu3nHrqqbmZ6Ze6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-we-left-off-with-emily-prentiss-on-criminal-minds.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where We Left Off With Emily Prentiss On Criminal Minds</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fashion-2024-y2k-purple-baker-hat.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fashion predictions for 2024 include purple becoming a big thing and ugly y2k hat making</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
