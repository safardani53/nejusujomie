After the astounding success of Apple TV’s Slow Horses, James Hawes has just taken on this project produced by 20th Century Fox.</p><p>According to sources, Amateur is still in its early phases of development, with Gary Spinelli authoring the first draft of the screenplay. This picture is unlikely to be released in 2023, but a release in 2024 seems to be a certain conclusion. Malek is most recognized for his roles in Mr. Robot and in Brian Singer’s Bohemian Rhapsody as rock legend Freddie Mercury. Amateur doesn’t have many details yet, but the producer has given a preliminary storyline.</p><h2>A vengeful CIA agent’s quest for revenge</h2><p>At first glance, the plot of the film Amateur looks to be a common notion that has been extensively explored in action and thriller films. The James Hawes film will purportedly depict a CIA cryptographer who goes pursues the killers of his wife when his colleagues refuse to aid him.</p><p>According to Deadline, the narrative of the film is as follows:</p><p>“The plot revolves around a CIA cryptographer who, after his wife is tragically murdered in a terrorist strike in London, insists that his superiors go after them. As it becomes evident that they would not act because of competing internal objectives, he blackmails the agency into training him and allowing him to go after them on his own.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Rami-Malek-2.jpg alt="Rami Malek" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It will be some time before the official description or trailer for the project is released. Yet, with such fascinating individuals already associated with the project, it is undeniably exciting.
