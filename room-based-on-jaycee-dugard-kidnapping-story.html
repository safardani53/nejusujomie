The main thing to remember is that the reality of captivity is different for each person.” <strong>Emma Donoghue</strong>‘s 2010 novel is about a fictional mother and her 5-year-old son who are held captive for years in a tiny structure they call “room.” Once the two find a way to escape, the boy begins to experience all the world has to offer outside of the “room.” The moving story was turned into the 2015 movie of the same name starring <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brie Larson</strong></a>, 26, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jacob Tremblay</strong></a>, 9.</p><h3><a class=pmclinkcontent-post href=# rel=noopener>Photos of ‘Room’ Star Brie Larson– PICS HERE</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jaycee told PEOPLE&nbsp;that, “the story gives false depiction of what reality is after captivity. The way the central character is treated is exactly what you should not do. Putting a survivor in the hospital with a doctor who looks like the perpetrator is exactly the wrong thing to do.” And if anyone knows how the situation should be handled it’s Jaycee, which is why she founded the <a class=tracklink3 href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>JAYC Foundation</a> – an organization that provides support and services to families recovering from abduction. We can definitely see why Jaycee would be offended by people assuming the book and movie are based on her experiences, as it is such a personal story.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>[jwplatform Hf81emFW]</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jaycee was kidnapped at 11 and held captive for 18 years, giving birth to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two daughters during that time</a>. Now, she’s been free for 7 wonderful years. “Survivors of crimes should not be treated like they are sick. It only makes them worse,” Jaycee said. “To really learn about situations like this you have to listen to people who have been through it.” We are so proud of her&nbsp;strength!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think about Jaycee’s reaction to&nbsp;Room?
