Quizzed about the video, Sam said: “We ain’t said anything, I can’t confirm or deny.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON SAM RYDER">READ MORE ON SAM RYDER</h2><p>“All I can say is, no one will ever see it, because of reasons beyond our control.</p><p>“But there is another video coming that we had to do very last minute.</p><p>“It’s a damage-control video. I made it in about eight hours. But the original, I can’t confirm it even exists.”</p><p>He kept schtum on exactly why the video was binned, but some have suggested Roy may not have been best pleased.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>Despite the drama, Sam is having a stellar moment and is now a very real contender for the Christmas No1 later this month — ahead of a busy 2024 in which he could win an Emmy for his single Fought & Lost.</p><p>Asked what is on the horizon, he said: “We’ve got album number two that we’re writing, it’s gonna be coming out.</p><p>“We don’t get much Christmas holiday on this team. We’re gonna be working up until the 23rd I think. And then we’re off again on January 6 for the Emmys.</p><p>“Fought & Lost is nominated for an Emmy.</p><p>“So fingers crossed for that. And yeah, festival season is gonna be bonkers.

A series of 30 British influencers who call themselves Creator Universe have teamed up to release their spin on I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day in favour of food bank charity The Trussell Trust.</p><p>They will face competition from The Pogues’ Fairytale Of New York following frontman <a href=#>Shane MacGowan’s death last month</a>.</p><p>The song peaked at No2 in 1987 and last week shot back up the chart to No4. The band and his family have backed a campaign to get it to the top and 7” vinyl singles will be released on Tuesday for charity.</p><p>Last week’s No1, <a href=#>Last Christmas by Wham!</a>, also stands a good chance, while bookmaker Coral has set odds for NoahKahan’s song Stick Season and <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>’s anthem All I Want For Christmas Is You, too.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Every Grinch of Lizzo is green</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hold-bizarre-no-online-use-866050581.jpg><p>FLU season is upon us – but <a href=#>Lizzo </a>looks more than just green around the gills after covering herself in paint.</p><p>The singer turned into the <a href=#>Grinch</a> for this snap shared on social media, complete with tiny nose and hair fingers.</p><p>It sounds like Lizzo shares the Dr Seuss character’s attitude towards Christmas, as she admitted she isn’t feeling the slightest bit festive.</p><p>After a tricky year that has seen her hit with <a href=#>allegations of sexual harassment from former dancers</a> – which she has denied – Lizzo wrote on Instagram: “This Grinch costume is the only thing saving me from depression.”</p><p>Let’s hope 2024 sees her fortunes change.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Not a Lot to smile about</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/57298be3-c0f4-4660-9fe7-a9fc303f296f.jpg><p>FOR someone who was <a href=#>wined and dined by Hollywood megastar Leonardo DiCaprio</a> the night before, Lottie Moss doesn’t look too happy.</p><p>She struggled to raise a smile at the Pretty Little Thing Christmas party in London on Wednesday evening, just as The Sun, below, told about her date with the Oscar winner.</p><p>The model was joined at the fashion party by Love Island’s Lucinda Strafford and <a href=#>Katie Price</a>’s kids Princess and Junior, which is definitely a downgrade from the A-list company of Leo.</p><p><a href=#>Leo</a> looked just as glum as he arrived in Paris yesterday for an Apple TV event at the Royal Monceau Hotel.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Myleene's snipping out</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/myleene-klass-enjoys-date-night-866119908.jpg><p><a href=#>MYLEENE KLASS</a> cut it on the red carpet when she attended the press night for a dance version of Edward Scissorhands.</p><p>The Hear’Say singer stepped out for the evening at Sadler’s Wells Theatre in North London.</p><p>TIM BURTON’s 1990 film has been re-imagined as a ballet, complete with stunning sets and parts of the original score by Danny Elfman.</p><p>The production will play in the capital until January 20 before touring the UK until May next year – including performances in Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Meg and Ren Mean business</h2><p><a href=#>MEGAN THEE STALLION</a> has teamed up with Renee Rap for a new song from the soundtrack of the movie musical remake of Mean Girls.</p><p>Renee plays Regina George in the movie, due to be released in January, but the track called Not My Fault is out today.</p><p>Meanwhile, US singer-songwriter AJ Mitchell has today dropped his song Passionate, which will be the lead single from his next album.</p><p>And the huge R&B soundtrack for musical movie The Color Purple has been released, featuring stars including Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Mary J.
