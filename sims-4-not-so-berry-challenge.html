The unusual spin on the fan-favorite game has been around for some time, calling on Sims addicts to push their personal limits and create entire dynasties.&nbsp;</p><p>It might be based on relatively simple-sounding rules, but make no mistake: completing the Not So Berry challenge won't be easy.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Sims 4' Not So Berry challenge is harder than you think.</h2><p>The challenge is thought to have been created partly in response to the increasing popularity of the Berry Sims trend, which requires players to create Sims with an immediately-recognizable aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>Unlike your standard Sim, Berry Sims come in pastel colors, with gumdrop-colored hair, teal skin, or soft pink clothes. The trend has some overlaps with the Not So Berry challenge, which assigns a specific color to every generation.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes the Not So Berry challenge different is that it also calls on gamers to guide 10 generations of Sims through life in accord with specific rules.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the "NOT SO BERRY LEGACY CHALLENGE" forum available on the official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sims</a> website, users eager to try their hands at the game face the mighty task of manipulating 10 generations of Sims into meeting specific targets.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Sims 4' Not So Berry challenge rules explained:</h2><p>One of the ground rules holds that the heir must represent the color of the generation.

The heir of "Generation Grey" is an athlete who has to get married several times. &nbsp;</p><p>User @alwaysimmingg describes the heir of "Generation Plum" as an "indecisive oddball," while that of "Generation Orange" is a petty criminal with aspirations to become the No. 1 enemy of the public. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My rose sim Amaranth just got engaged to this poor girl who's gonna get left at the altar.
