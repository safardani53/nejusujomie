His penis looks like a Ken Doll. Like, it’s just a bulge.</p><p>"Look at that, it’s like a ‘mangina.’”</p><p>Joe claimed in his filing that the photos depicted required “no blurring” because his penis could not be seen. He said the “intentional and malicious blurring” of the photos was to suggest his genitals could be seen in the pictures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/AP_330831798110.jpg><p>The complaint also alleged cast member Craig “falsely” said of Joe on the show: “Well, he’s a disgraced politician in Florida… He’s not running for re-election because of his divorce. His wife is accusing him of being physically abusive.”</p><p>He claimed the statements are “false” and made to show him in a “false light.”</p><p>He then alleged that he ended their relationship in the Fall of 2019, not Kathyrn because of “concerns” from her cast members, as the show portrayed.</p><p>Joe also claimed in the court papers the Defendants “falsely and maliciously” compared him to former cast member and Kathryn’s ex, Thomas Ravenel, who has been criminally charged with assault.</p><p>Joe alleged the show consists of “false conflict” and “fabricated” scenarios for the purpose of “creating dramatic material for television.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/GettyImages-1144063804.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in entertainment</h2></p><p>He claimed the scenes caused him “emotional distress.”</p><p>Joe continued: “The emotional distress suffered was severe such that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it and it had physical manifestations of pain, loss of sleep, nervousness, stress, anxiety, damage to reputation, and other manifestations.”</p><p>The lawsuit claimed a work agreement was “terminated” shortly after Southern Charm episodes aired.</p><p>Joe is asking for $10 million.</p><p>Craig said over Instagram Live regarding the lawsuit: “I just got served. They finally found me.”</p><p>He admitted he didn’t read all of it and that he’ll “deal with it another day.”</p><p>Bravo has not responded to the lawsuit and did not immediately reply to The Sun's request for comment.</p><p>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p>Email us at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusive@the-sun.com</a> or call <a href=# rel=nofollow>212 416 4552</a>.</p><p>Like us on Facebook at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/TheSunUS/&source=gmail&ust=1585920132770000&usg=AFQjCNEdH4ZCl4KpX1mV7HhIDDOsAu-2dw">www.facebook.com/TheSunUS</a> and follow us from our main Twitter account at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/TheSunUS&source=gmail&ust=1585920132770000&usg=AFQjCNFOm8E4sns-q4X_0Zwnez13xwMqJA">@TheSunUS</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZWmDcoKOrKaurJiav695wqGYq6VdoK61tNGypWaclaO7qr%2BMnq9mop%2BaeqKu0a6xs6ddqMKmv4ybqZqun2K9prrIrGSdoaOYwrS%2FyKilaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amazing-race.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tim and Marie - The Amazing Race Cast Member</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rajat-patidar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rajat Patidar- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Career, Girlfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
