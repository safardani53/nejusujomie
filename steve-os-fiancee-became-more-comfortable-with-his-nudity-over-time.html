I was kinda shocked!”</p><p><a href=#>Spirited Comedy Stars</a></p><p>“She told me ‘We’re in an intimate relationship, so I feel like that’s my penis, and I don’t like you showing it to the whole world,” the Jackass alum admitted. But Steve-O had another vision for his <i>Gnarly&nbsp;</i>comedy special — that was way more R-rated.</p><p>The newly engaged couple did come to an unconventional comprise to work through the issues of Steve-O’s full-frontal nudity. “We sort of worked through it, and then we hit a milestone which represented us sort of being past that. She agreed to paint my penis for a dick painting stunt I was doing” he told Us. “That represented her kind of getting over the hump.”</p><p>Steve-O and Lux have pushed back their wedding date, due to the coronavirus pandemic, but are still moving forward on their shared goal to open an animal farm: “We want to not be the Tiger King, we don’t really have a model we want to emulate yet, but I’ve always liked how ‘the Gentle Barn’ is run, we want an opportunity for people to have a personal encounter with the animals and hopefully that will cause them to be nicer to animals in their everyday life.”</p><p>“We’re going to purchase our own animal sanctuary and we’re excited to live and retire on the sanctuary,” he continued. “I mean at our house in the Hollywood Hills we are a bonafide menagerie, we have four dogs, two cats and believe it or not, three goats.”</p><p><a href=#>The Changing Faces of Comedy</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Steve-O, who has been sober since 2008, attributed his healing to his love for animals. “Rescuing and being kind to animals is something that builds up my self-esteem, because every time I can make a decision which was based on compassion and being considerate of animals, that strengthens my spirituality,” he added.</p><p>Check out Steve-O’s newest special Gnarly on his <a href=#>website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJWrsm670madopmemLKmecGempqllWK6sL7EZpqopZakv7WtwaWcZq%2BZqbVutMisZKetlJ7BunnOr5yrZaSeuqZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bianca-my-600-lb-life-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Bianca Hayes from 'My 600-lb Life' Now?
