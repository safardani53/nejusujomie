Crosses of St George and Union Jack flags were adorning pubs and homes.</p><p>Caterer and mum-of-five Sally Shuttleworth, 58, said: “I’ve never been so elated as when I saw the Brexit result come in.</p><p>“Boston is an example of how Britain has lost its identity with all the Polish shops.</p><p>“We need tighter border controls. Immigrants are hard workers but there is too much pressure on the system, on schools, and hospitals.</p><p>“You could tell by the number of people streaming out of polling stations that the vote meant a lot to the town.”</p><p>In January the Boston area was named the most murderous place in England and Wales, with 15 cases per 100,000 people.</p><p>It also has the unwanted title of least integrated town in the UK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000247220281.jpg><p>Translators are employed at Park Academy primary school where half the children speak Eastern European languages.</p><p>Retired agricultural mechanic Ron Holmes, 69, added: “I’m delighted. The whole town is.</p><p>“Whether you think the EU or immigration is right or wrong things have to stop in Boston.</p><p>“It is crippling the UK and we had to deal with it once and for all and vote out.</p><p>“The EU wasted money on so many things. They should have put the money in places like Latvia and Estonia to build them up so those people would not want to come here. We should never have joined the Common Market in 1975.

We have had enough of the EU telling us what we can and cannot do. Not being able to control who comes in the country is a big problem. Now we can hopefully get a points system that will allow skilled people in.</p><p>“I’m hoping it will free up more roles for British-born people.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000247477103.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Related Stories</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict0002474107701.jpg><p>Their feelings were shared across the UK — though many admitted not knowing which way to vote until Referendum day.</p><p>Retired sales manager David Cunliffe, 63, of Plymouth, said: “Without the control of our borders we have no nation.</p><p>“It doesn’t make you a racist to want to see some sort of control.</p><p>“I don’t mind immigration. But we shouldn’t leave our keys in the front door.</p><p>“Throughout it all you just didn’t know who to believe. I had always been on the fence but I decided at the last minute to vote out.</p><p>“I had hoped it could be reformed but I don’t think the EU is capable. It is so undemocratic.”</p><p>Geologist Joseph Kennedy, 29, of Portsmouth, said: “I’m not opposed to immigration but we can not physically sustain the numbers.</p><p>“I am thinking about the schools and public services and what is good for our children.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000247220199.jpg><p>Mum Lauren Wardle, 19, backed Leave.

I’m still not sure if it is the right one.</p><p>“I heard all the bad news about the economy this morning which took the edge of the result.</p><p>“Maybe they should have another referendum in five years if things aren’t going so well.”</p><h2>We couldn't see&nbsp;GP</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000247428988.jpg><p>HOLDING back the tears, Tom Ridyard passionately belted out the national anthem.</p><p>Standing in Bolton town centre to mark Armed Forces Day, he said he felt “extra proud to be British” yesterday.</p><p>Leave voter Tom, 74, said: “Brexit has been a win for the real people of Britain. Here in Bolton, we are affected by the issues that affect people’s lives.</p><p>“Whether that is not being able to get on the housing ladder or be seen by your doctor because of the influx of migrants and cuts.</p><p>“People in the big cities are worried about the banking industry but I think that’s the least of our worries. Brexit was a vote for the normal folk living in the sticks or smaller towns.”</p><p>The people of Bolton voted 58 per cent in favour of Brexit.</p><p>Yesterday, just two days after 72 per cent of the town voted, people embraced on the Union Jack-lined streets. Every other conversation was about Brexit.</p><p>Former soldier Geoff Lowe, 70, who served in Northern Ireland for the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment for ten years, said voting for Brexit made him “just as proud” as fighting for his country.</p><p>The dad of three said: “I’m so happy that smaller places like Bolton delivered ‘Out’ rather than those who live in a metropolitan bubble.”</p><p>Despite their complaints about immigration, just two per cent of people in the town were born in EU countries while across Greater Manchester it is 2.5 per cent.</p><p>Mum-of-two Hayley McGwynn, 29, voted Remain and struggled to hide her disappointment.

It’s not right someone like him born and bred here wants to work and can’t.” Across the sprawling market town, about 20 miles from Birmingham, Vote Leave posters were still hung proudly in windows.</p><p>Retired painter and decorator Norman Paddock, 69, said: “When I was in the building trade as a contractor you had to pay £2,500 and wait to get a card to work. What sealed it for me was when a Polish chap walked on site, said he was carpenter and got a card without having to wait or pay.”</p><p>Butcher Ryan Metcalfe, 18, was delighted to vote for the first time.</p><p>He said: “I don’t think people of my age have a lot of trust in the politicians.
