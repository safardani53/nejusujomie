At age 20, after studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, she moved to Europe to pursue a career in modeling. While in Spain, she was cast in a regular role in the TV show Dark Justice, which was produced in Barcelona for its first season. She followed the series to its new shooting location in Los Angeles the next year. Once in Los Angeles, she began getting more opportunities, one of which was a TV series, Matrix, which coincidentally presaged the movie that would later make her famous, another was being cast as a series regular for Aaron Spelling's television spectacle Models Inc.<p>Carrie-Anne's work was already gaining traction throughout the motion picture casting community when the late great casting director Mali Finn invited Carrie-Anne to audition for The Wachowski's and their top secret sci-fi action project that activated her explosive film career. The writer/directors recognized Carrie-Anne's empowered yet openhearted leading qualities and, following a challenging process of physical and character screen tests, they ultimately gave her the opportunity to create the iconic cyber warrior Trinity in the record-breaking, award-winning and internationally successful The Matrix trilogy for Warner Bros/Village Roadshow. Her extraordinary performance launched her onto the world stage alongside her One, Keanu Reeves, in stride with Laurence Fishburne and the multifaceted Hugo Weaving. Carrie-Anne Moss galvanized her place in cinematic history as the first woman to triumphantly fight her way through one of the highest grossing sci-fi action franchises of all time.</p><p>Directly following her phenomenal new-found success, Carrie-Anne received a wide range of scripts from studios and A-list filmmakers, but it was the complex screenplay Memento that stirred her creative senses. After meeting the then unknown writer/director Christopher Nolan, without hesitation she accepted the role of Natalie in Nolan's directorial debut. Starring opposite Guy Pearce, and produced by Jennifer and Suzanne Todd, Memento became one of the most critically acclaimed and, at that time, the largest grossing independent film in history. Carrie-Anne Moss's remarkable performance won her the coveted Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female that year.</p><p>Many of Hollywood's prominent directors and producers continued to pursue her for films. She survived the Red Planet for Warner Bros; sweetened Lasse Hallström's multi Oscar nominated Chocolat with Juliette Binoche, Dame Judi Dench, and Johnny Depp; and tracked Suspect Zero alongside Aaron Eckhart and the elusive Sir Ben Kingsley in the Cruise/Wagner produced film.</p><p>But it was over the next years that Carrie-Anne took on the most important and rewarding role of her life: becoming a mother to her three children. During that same time, Carrie-Anne also mothered on screen with the watchful Shia LaBeouf in the Rear Window-esque DreamWorks box-office hit Disturbia, and together with Samuel L. Jackson, led the intense terrorist interrogation of Michael Sheen in Sony's Unthinkable.<br>Carrie-Anne continued to accept many other lead roles in interesting film projects, including The Chumscrubber with Ralph Fiennes and Glenn Close; the comedy noir Mini's First Time, also starring Alec Baldwin and Luke Wilson; Snow Cake, the touching drama with Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman; Fireflies in the Garden in the company of Ryan Reynolds, Julia Roberts, and Willem Defoe; and the retro zombie rom-com Fido along with Billy Connelly and Dylan Baker. It is Carrie-Anne's inclination towards thought-provoking filmmakers that has inspired her to lend her success to many other indie projects, including Normal, Silent Hill, Elephant Song, Pompeii, Brain on Fire, The Bye Bye Man, and more.</p><p>Throughout her career, Carrie-Anne has been attracted to compelling television projects as well, such as Ryan Murphy's, before its time, one hour FOX pilot Pretty Handsome where she played the curious wife to a cross-dressing Joseph Fiennes while dealing with her society mother-in-law, Blythe Danner; CBS' Vegas, a sin city period piece playing Nevada's first woman District Attorney for James Mangold and Nicholas Pileggi, which also starred the lawful Dennis Quaid and gaming Michael Chiklis; and a guest-starring arc throughout the second season of AMC's Humans, experimenting as a highly regarded scientist with a deeply personal agenda, working alongside Gemma Chan.</p><p>Carrie-Anne Moss has recently completed her third and final season as the powerful and enduring attorney Jerry Hogarth, navigating her way through the Marvel universe in Jessica Jones for Netflix, opposite Krysten Ritter and for show runner Melissa Rosenberg. In between seasons, she tucked into the first bi-lingual English/Norwegian detective crime series Wisting, as an FBI agent who is following the leads to catch a serial killer in the Norwegian landscape.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa3RmqSorZ6pva3B0meaqKVfqLWww9Joqq6qpp7DsL6OnJisrF9nfnd%2Bl2tm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./get-onlyfans-free.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to get OnlyFans for free</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./autumn-joi-19820126-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Autumn-Joi (Radio Host) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
