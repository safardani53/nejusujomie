But everyone still had big questions for Ryan about his past, and his present.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_01_tamrajudge_vickigunvalson_shannonbeador-1024x576.png><p>On the Wednesday, August 2 episode of RHOC, Shannon returned to the table after demanding that producers not include footage of Tamra alluding to Shannon’s relationship secret.</p><p>Vicki Gunvalson reinforced Shannon for trying to insist that the show not include any of that.</p><p>She felt distressed that Heather had allegedly shared things. “I was vulnerable, I’m a stupid s–t that thought it was going to be kept between the two of us,” Shannon explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_02_emilysimpson-1024x576.png><p>Tamra took steps to avoid being specific, and apologized for bringing it up at all.</p><p>She also dished to Shannon that Heather Dubrow has apparently been sharing things with Gina Kirschenheiter and Emily Simpson, too. Whoops!</p><p>Shannon vowed to confront Heather, saying that this was a “100% complete betrayal.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_03_jenniferpedranti-1024x576.png><p>Later, Tamra sat down with Jennifer Pedranti. They’re friends, but they’ve been at odds.</p><p>A lot of that is just about Jennifer’s boyfriend Ryan, and rumors about Ryan, and factual things about Ryan.</p><p>But another issue was Tamra’s behavior. She blamed this to her state of mind. “I’m a person who doesn’t deal with my emotions and then I explode,” Tamra said accurately of herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_04_tamrajudge-1024x576.png><p>Of course, speaking to the camera, Tamra admitted that she hasn’t changed any of her thoughts about Ryan.</p><p>In her mind, the issue is solely that she’s been such a jerk towards Jennifer. That was never her intention. (She’s just like that)</p><p>Tamra made a conciliatory gesture, saying that she’d be open to meeting Ryan and clearing the air. Jennifer appreciated the gesture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_05_heatherdubrow-1024x576.png><p>Meanwhile, we saw some personal and professional stuff from others.</p><p>Heather sat down with Mark Cuban, which really just means that they were promoting their project.</p><p>Emily and Shane talked about parenting. Gina discussed her real estate career and the journey that has brought her here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_06_ginakirschenheiter-1024x576.png><p>Heather Dubrow, Tamra Judge, and Jennifer Pedranti hung out. Now, this was interesting.</p><p>Tamra was basically testing Heather, who did not say or leak anything about Shannon and John.</p><p>So while Tamra characterizes Heather as some sort of blabbermouth about Shannon’s secrets, that’s not how she was coming across.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_07_tamrajudge_jenniferpedranti_heatherdubrow-1024x576.png><p>Meanwhile, Heather made it very clear that she’s not going to spill Shannon’s secrets.</p><p>Not to Tamra, anyway.</p><p>Characterizing Tamra as someone who would immediately share what she’s heard, Heather explained why she’s not sharing too much with Tamra.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_08_heatherdubrow-1024x576.png><p>Anyway, the big event was a group ride on John Janssen’s boat, followed by dinner.</p><p>Jennifer was there and so was Ryan. Tamra helped to make that happen.</p><p>But Tamra also told John about what Ryan had allegedly said about her. And Eddie Judge told the camera about how he keeps Ryan at “arms length.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_12_jenniferpedranti_ryan-1024x576.png><p>The boat ride was awkward, to say the least.</p><p>Then, they headed to the restaurant. Everyone could feel the tension, including Ryan.</p><p>He cracked a joke about having sent that dong pic … at which point Tamra asked if he would like to discuss it, since he brought it up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_14_tamrajudge_eddiejudge-1024x576.png><p>This led to a brief intermission in which Shannon commented on the whole concept.</p><p>Apparently, she doesn’t understand the appeal of receiving a picture of a penis — no matter what it looks like or who sent it.</p><p>You know, everyone’s into different stuff. Some things click, and others don’t. And Shannon’s nearly 60 years old. It’s fine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_15_shannonbeador-1024x576.png><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46>“First and foremost, brother, I could cry,” Ryan told Tamra. “I owe you an apology, because I care about you and if something was told to me even though later I found out it was not true, it’s just not cool.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48>He added: “I’m actually empathetic, it hurts my heart to see the hurt that [Jenn] is dealing with on my behalf.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48>But Ryan didn’t stop there. He told Tamra and Eddie: “I’m feeling so truly hurt and I will be honest, a bit betrayed by you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_16_ryan-1024x576.png><p>Eddie was clearly also feeling honest, as he told Ryan that he “couldn’t help but come to the conclusion” that Ryan is a serial cheater. This came from warnings that he’d heard, and what he’d witnessed himself.</p><p>Ryan did admit that he had cheated on his wife multiple times. But he also claimed that he never said that he would “f–k” Tamra.</p><p>He claimed that Heather Amin was the liar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_17_johnjanssen_shannonbeador-1024x576.png><p>Shannon clearly had thoughts about that.</p><p>She has known (this) Heather for many years.</p><p>And she does not know Heather to be a liar. At all. So … she tends to believe what she’s heard about Ryan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_18-1024x576.png><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56>Eddie then asked Ryan a question, point blank: “Did you cheat on Jenn?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58>“I did not,” Ryan answered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58>But … he said that he had boned another woman while they were on a break. They’d become too serious for his comfort.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0803_rhoc_19_jenniferpedranti-1024x576.png><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62>To the confessional camera, Jennifer expressed that she did not like hearing that. It felt like cheating, even if they were on a break.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64>“In my mind if we’re still communicating with me saying this stuff and saying, ‘I miss you,’” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64>Jennifer asked: “How the hell do you go sleep with somebody?
