You're literally deranged."</p><p>Amber yelled back: "I'm clinically deranged!"</p><p>Ashley again asked Amber what she wanted while laughing at their interaction before the clip cut out.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>FANS' REACTIONS</h2><p>The video surfaced on an online thread, where fans begged <a href=#>MTV</a> to cut ties with Amber for her behavior.</p><p>"She 100% should be kicked off," one person proposed.</p><p>"Amber can abuse other cast members and not get fired- She must have something on MTV because nobody likes her, and she still never gets fired…" another complained.</p><p>"She told Ashley this will be her last season because she's getting her fired or something like that, so we will see. It'll be great to see Amber be fired and be able to replay what she said," a third pointed out.</p><p>"Asking MTV why they aren’t consistent with their employees being held to a standard can make me laugh all the way to my grave," chimed in a fourth.</p><h2>EXPLOSIVE FEUD</h2><p>The incident that prompted Amber's rant occurred as the ladies left the Teen Mom Family Reunion set.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashleys Reality Roundup</a>&nbsp;reported on two incidents that took place - <a href=#>one involving Ashley</a> and her co-star <a href=#>Briana DeJesus</a>, 28 - and the other between Ashley and Amber.</p><p>A source told the outlet: "At the end of filming, all the girls other than Ashley got into two vans to leave the set. They passed Ashley on their way out and she realized who was in the vans. That's when she began doing her signature twerking moves at the second van."</p><p>The outlet did not reveal that Amber was upset by the move, but an insider said: "A lot of the girls found it super disrespectful and it really angered one girl in particular. Someone who had not had any previous disagreements with Ashley and had previously really liked her."</p><p>It was only once Ashley leaked the call between herself and Amber that it became clear who the insider was talking about.</p><h2>LEGAL ISSUES</h2><p>Fans have watched Amber's complicated past play out on screen, though she has appeared to turn her life around in the latest season.</p><p>In 2010, the TV star faced<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;domestic abuse&nbsp;</a>charges when she hit her ex-partner and baby daddy, Gary Shirley, while Teen Mom cameras were rolling.</p><p>Gary was given full custody of their daughter, Leah, 13, when she spent 17 months in jail for violating her drug probation requirements in 2012.</p><p>She later found herself in more legal trouble after she was&nbsp;<a href=#>arrested for domestic violence</a>&nbsp;against her now ex-Andrew Glennon in July 2019.</p><p>The former partners are parents to a 4-year-old son, James.</p><p>Amber <a href=#>lost custody of James</a> in July 2022 after a heated three-year court battle with&nbsp;<a href=#>Andrew</a>, 38.</p><p>Earlier this month, The U.S. Sun confirmed that Andrew and James moved 2,000 miles away from Amber's Indiana home at his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mother's $5 million estate</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Malibu</a>.</p><p>Last week, Amber <a href=#>urged fans to be kind</a> since the court ruling in an Instagram post.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The TV personality shared a photo of a bunch of dried flowers with text that read: "Be nice or leave."</p><p>Amber&nbsp;captioned the photo: "Walk a mile in my shoes" and added the hashtags "holdingittogether" and "walkamileinmyshoes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/NINTCHDBPICT000725570500-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/teen-moms-plastic-surgeries-revealed-738640227.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZWuCeX6WaKuenZ5iurC5jJqkm52iYr2wvtOwpqicXZu2s7HDZpisoJyaxm62zqecrGWilru1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-mom-fans-shocked-cast-member-missing-family-reunion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teen Mom fans shocked after key cast member is missing from new Family Reunion trailer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./master-p-net-worth-how-rich-is-he-lifestyle-and-career-highlights.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Master P Net Worth: How Rich Is He?
