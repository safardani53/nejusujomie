Ashley spit on Briana, and then someone started throwing stuff. It got more physical before it was finally broken up. But all four of the women were fighting each other.</p><p>Briana has since addressed the fight on social media and warned Ashley she will be taking legal action.</p><h2>LEAH'S REMARKS</h2><p>While the TV personality didn't attend the filming of Family Reunion, Leah has been involved in some drama of her own since her split from ex-fiance <a href=#>Jaylan Mobley</a>.</p><p>The MTV star took to her Instagram Stories last week to <a href=#>throw shade at her ex</a>, by reposting a scathing tweet she'd previously shared.</p><p>The tweet read: "NO approval or validation is ever needed when it comes to YOUR life, your BOUNDARIES, and what your heart DESIRES. Let this be known and if it isn't respected, stand UP for yourself."</p><p>And in her Instagram post, she added: "I would like to add that in the dinner scene after the proposal it was known that no other blessings were needed or mattered especially if I was going to open myself to marriage after two failed marriages.</p><p>"I love my family BUT I have a very private relationship with them and preferred to keep it that way as we build better relationships with healthier boundaries."</p><p>Leah continued: "I call the scene with my stepdad a publicity stunt and disrespect at its finest when you asked me prior and proceeded to do so anyway… then tell me on camera after you propose. Smh.</p><p>"You deserve better, never settle," the mom-of-three added.</p><p>Leah and Jaylan got engaged in August when he popped the question with a 4.7-carat custom ring during their anniversary trip to Costa Rica.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>However, fans were shocked when just months later it was revealed that they had parted ways.</p><p>Shortly after Leah confirmed the split, it was revealed that Jaylan had been accused of cheating on her - and this has now been referenced&nbsp;<a href=#>in a scene from the season finale</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/leah-messer-premieres-jan-3-782715568.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/baby-teen-mom-leah-messer-760595335.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/teen-mom-fans-divided-leah-765265545.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaWWGeIWYaKuenZ5iurC5jJ%2BYp6tdqLWwr8qem2abkajBbrnEppmeql2itrS%2FyKeeZp6RoratxYyrnK6mmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./action-league-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Action League Now - Nickelodeon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-mom-amber-portwood-fired-ashley-jones-rant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Teen Mom fans demand Amber Portwood be fired after she 'threatens' co-star Ashley Jones in furious r</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
