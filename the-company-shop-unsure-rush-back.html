membership to shop at The Company Shop and once signed up, members can enjoy a unique way of shopping, with products from well-known brands at amazing prices, helping <a href=#>stretched budgets</a> go further.</p><p>Membership is open to employees and pension recipients of the NHS, Care and Emergency Services, Prison Service, British Armed Forces, Charity and the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods

amazing idea.</p><p>“They have so many bargains and it's such a good way to help with the current climate of today's <a href=#>cost-of-living crisis</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading

did go on a Friday night, so I don't know if it's best to go early in the morning.</p><p>“They even had vapes, car things, make-up, everything you can think of was in this mother****ing shop, even alcohol.</p><p>“If you are eligible to get membership, you need to work for charity or the NHS or a public service, some benefits are also eligible to get membership, then definitely check it out, because I think it's an amazing thing and respect to The Company Shop for making this possible.”&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew’s clip has clearly impressed many, as it has quickly amassed 42.1k views.</p><p>It has 685 likes, 24 comments and 100 shares.</p><p>But social media users were also divided over The Company Shop, as many shared their thoughts on the chain in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>One person said: “You need to be there first thing in the morning.”</p><p>Another added: “Shelves being bare is a good thing as it’s the products being sold. They don’t get loads of stock like big supermarkets.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, one user commented: “I don’t think everything is cheap there anymore.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Whilst another claimed: “Worst shop ever!!! When it first opened it was great, went downhill rapid!”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, someone else asked “Anyone know if there is a better time or day to go?” to which Matthew claimed “Apparently they do a restock on a Sunday morning.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e8Wopp1nYmaEcYOYcG5orJiaeqS7zKmYp7FdqLWwvIyupaytopp6s8HSoWSbmZOgfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kfir-ochaion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kfir Ochaion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brad-daugherty.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brad Daugherty</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
