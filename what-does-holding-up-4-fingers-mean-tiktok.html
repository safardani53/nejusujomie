For some reason, folks back in the day would sternly look at the camera as if they were promised $1 million to sit through an hour-long stand-up comedy routine and not laugh. Or because, you know, they were living in a time where indoor plumbing wasn't promised.</p><p>A recently photo/video trend, however, has folks holding up four fingers, and many are wondering: What does it mean?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does holding up four fingers mean on TikTok?</h2><p>There are tons of hand gestures and signs that implement the use of four fingers, but we'll start with some of the most likely origins of how this sign got popular.</p><p>During a 2019 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Ones</a> interview with DaBaby, the rapper explained the context behind a photo he took with a middle-aged white fan, where he asked her to "put the fours up."</p><p>A 2019 post in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Dictionary</a> claims that the practice originated in Florida where individuals would use the signal to indicate that they were representing their block, most likely from "North Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, Oakland Park, or Broward County."</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit post</a> that referenced the interview with DaBaby, one user wrote: "It’s a gang sign, that’s why it’s funny he got a middle aged white lady to do it."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Although it's said to be a Florida-based "gang" sign, it's not hard to imagine that when a few public figures and influential people began tossing up the fours that others would start to emulate it in their own photos and videos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">However, there are other reasons why people put "four" fingers up.</h2><p>The sign can translate to "maximum effort" on the football field. Players will hold up four fingers to intone that the final, most crucial 15 minutes of the game are about to be played. The signal is a reminder to everyone to stay frosty and put forth the best game that they can.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dictionary.tn</a> writes: "When the clock expires at the end of the third quarter, teams hold up four fingers to signify the beginning of the most important 15 minutes of the game. The fourth quarter is when games are won, and legends are made. Fourth quarters are why players work so hard in the offseason with the weightlifting and the running."</p><p>So perhaps folks throwing up four fingers is an homage to that "beast mode" mentality players try to embody while on the field, and people are encouraging others to walk into every avenue of their lives and put forth their best effort. Whether it's going after the career you want or messaging prospective dates on Tinder, remember: You should always live life like you're about to head into the fourth quarter, #blessup.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Back in 2017, holding up four fingers in a selfie meant that you were helping to bring awareness to mental health issues, as one in four people struggle with them.
