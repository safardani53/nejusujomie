And let's not forget the amount of money she made from not only appearing on the show but what she continues to make thanks to streaming services and royalty checks.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Lacey from 'Love After Lockup' do?</h2><p>Thanks to Lacey's fame, she's become an entrepreneur who's not working in just one field to make cash. For $25, you can buy a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameo</a> from her, and Shane will even make an appearance by request. She's also a consultant with Scentsy. Through her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">custom link</a>, people can shop Scentsy's website like usual, but there's also a section with Lacey's handpicked fragrances. Lacey gets a cut of each sale. A page on Scenty's website says consultants make 20 percent of each sale.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Lacey also has a partnership with Q Sciences, a self-care product company. She gets a cut of every sale made through her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">custom link</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Like so many others today, Lacey also has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OnlyFans</a>. For less than $20 a month, users can get access to photos and videos of her. Although there is no public content, she lists different kinds of adult content that she has available behind her paywall, which includes full-length videos in 4K and custom content.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to her OnlyFans, Lacey has also performed under the name Kaci Kash and even won some awards in the adult industry. Some of the content she has suggests that she needs a partner so it's possible that Shane may make appearances there as well.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Lacey still get paid from 'Love After Lockup'?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a>, whenever a show is bought by a streaming service or reruns are aired, the cast of those shows are given royalty checks. It's not clear how much the cast of Love After Lockup makes in royalties or how much Lacey makes separately, but the show is currently available on WE tv, Amazon Prime, YouTube TV, Sling, and more.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starcasm also reports</a> that the Love After Lockup cast gets paid $2,000 per episode per season and an additional $250 per day for any other kind of extra shoots for the show like reunions or catch ups.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lacey and Shane appeared on both Love After Lockup and Life After Lockup, but it's unclear if the stars get paid the same amount of money for appearing on each show. But if so, this means that Lacey easily got paid thousands of dollars for her time on TV. Life After Lockup also streams on a bunch of different platforms too and that only adds to her paycheck.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXaGupLHYZp2rp51iubDCxGaYn6yVp3qtu8KkrKlllKQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-viktor-bout-arms-dealer-4954914.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Viktor Bout?
