Typically, that means they were songs off of albums that were never released as singles. Now, many want to know why the channel disappeared, and whether it could come back.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Deep Tracks on SiriusXM?</h2><p>Deep Tracks appears to have been removed from SiriusXM as of Nov. 8, 2023. The station has become an internet-only station, Channel 308, a fate that has also befallen other channels over the years, and means that older cars can't access it. Unfortunately, SiriusXM hasn't offered much in the way of explanation for its decision, but it seems likely that the channel was quietly retired in large part because it didn't have enough listeners to justify its continued existence on satellite radio.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now, many fans of the channel are rallying in an attempt to return it to the airwaves.</p><p>"I love Deep Tracks. Too much great music to lose. While 60s Gold, 70s on 7 and The Bridge repeat the same old hits day after day, Deep Tracks presents great stuff that I never heard over the airwaves. I hope it doesn’t leave Sirius," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person wrote</a> on a message board following the news that the station had left.</p><p>"It's one of my [go-to] stations. I'm curious what will be taking it's place on that channel. I would very much like it to stay put. Where do I sign?" another wrote, referring to the petition to bring the channel back.</p><p>SiriusXM has brought channels back in the past due to popular demand, but it's undoubtedly going to be an uphill battle for fans of the channel hoping to see it restored to its rightful place.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@SIRIUSXM</a> decision to move <a href=#>#DeepTracks</a> to ch. 308 is odd. It was fine where it was. But to move it to a channel where 'older' cars cannot access it - and with the channel's general demographic probably having lots of those 'older' cars - it just doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>— Platform & Stream (@PlatformStream) <a href=#>November 8, 2023</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@PlatformStream</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Satellite radio is not what it once was.</h2><p>SiriusXM is likely long past the peak of its popularity. Thanks to the advent of streaming music, many people have left their SiriusXM subscriptions behind, which may mean that Deep Tracks is not the last channel to go as they continue to cut costs.</p><p>Even as fans battle to keep the stations they love on the air, SiriusXM is trying to find a way forward that allows it to stay in business. While they haven't said this yet, it seems possible that many more stations could become available only on the Internet in the years ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSdnZWlerW%2BwJyirGWfo3q0tdGirKywnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./felix-tshisekedi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Flix Tshisekedi net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rapper-meek-mill-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rapper Meek Mill: Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
