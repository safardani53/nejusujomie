family that you just don't know what buy them.</p><p>You know they have an <a href=#>Xbox</a> but you don't have a clue what type of games they are into, well we may have the answer to all of your problems.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

at various online outlets.</p><p>Upon purchase, you’ll receive an email with a digital code that your gift recipient can use to buy popular <a href=#>games</a>, add-ons, map packs and more.</p><p>The gift card can also be used to buy movies and TV shows on Xbox, as well as apps on Windows, and even devices like <a href=#>Xbox</a> consoles.</p><p>In the UK, the easiest place to buy them is directly from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft website</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON XBOX">READ MORE ON XBOX</h2><p>They give you the option to buy gift cards that range from £10-£50.</p><p>You can similarly purchase gift cards from:</p><p>If you are in the <a href=#>US</a>, your first stop when buying an Xbox gift card should also be the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Microsoft online store</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Gaming</h2></p><p>There, you can purchase one for as little as $1, and up to $100.</p><p>If you're looking for other online retailers, try any of these:</p><p>Beware that Xbox gift cards are in local currency, so they only work in the country they are purchased from.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">XBOX LATEST</h2></p><h2>Which shops sell Xbox gift cards?</h2><p>If you prefer to purchase gift cards the traditional way and go into a store, there are many retailers who offer a physical copy.</p><p>It's an easy process and eliminates the risk of security scams associated with online shopping.</p><p>However, be sure to check with your local retailer first as products can differ from store to store.</p><p>Both the UK and the US offer some great options for buying gift cards in-store:</p><ul><li>Currys</li><li>Argos</li><li>WHSmith</li><li>Walmart</li><li>Best Buy</li></ul><h2>What are the dangers of Xbox gift cards?</h2><p>While it’s often said that giving gift cards is “impersonal,” it turns out most people are just fine with that, as they remain incredibly popular with customers.</p><p>People enjoy the flexibility and convenience of gift cards.</p><p>Unfortunately, gift cards are prime targets for <a href=#>scammers</a> and fraudsters, and gift card fraud can leave merchants vulnerable to damaging chargebacks from the <a href=#>credit cards</a> that were originally used to purchase them.&nbsp;</p><p>With physical gift cards, which are still the more popular option, the person receiving one has to make sure to register it on time.</p><p>Otherwise, the card may easily be lost or stolen, and it can be very difficult to get a refund if it hadn't been registered.</p><p>While <a href=#>Microsoft</a> assures users that gift cards redeemable in their store never expire, there is always a danger of losing the money if the company goes out of business, for example.</p><p>Another thing to be aware of is that while Xbox gift cards don't expire, promotional gift cards such as those from Microsoft Rewards or Xbox Live Rewards do.</p><h2>Are there any Xbox gift card scams to watch out for?</h2><p>In July 2021, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> about an elaborate Xbox gift card scam, where a Microsoft employee stole more than $10 million from the US giant.</p><p>Volodymyr Kvashuk found a glitch where he could generate gift card codes and trade them for Bitcoin, which he then turned to cash.</p><p>Scammers <a href=#>often send emails</a> which appear to be from the official Microsoft account but are intended to steal personal data.</p><p>Although elaborate <a href=#>scams like that do exist</a>, there are ways to remain smart about your gift card purchases online.</p><p><h3
