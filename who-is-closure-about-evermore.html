There's one song in general that sticks out and makes us wonder who it's about, and that's "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closure</a>."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The chorus goes, "Yes I got your letter / yes I'm doing better," with lyrics like "Don't treat me like some situation that needs to be handled / I'm fine with my spite / And my tears / And my beers and my candles / I can feel you smoothing me over." It's one of the best post-breakup anthems we've ever heard in a long time — probably because it feels extremely personal and extremely relatable. So who is Taylor Swift talking about?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is 'Closure' about in 'Evermore'?</h2><p>"Closure" could be about any of Taylor Swift's exes, like Tom Hiddleston or Harry Styles (some Redditors have pointed out "Yes I got your letter / yes I'm doing better" sounds a bit like the singer is adopting an English accent, which some think could mean it could be any of her English exes).</p><p>Or she could be talking about her very public feud with producer Scooter Braun, who had sold her first six albums for $300 million to an investment fund this past November. Or, "Closure" could totally be about a friend, since friendship breakups cut deep, too.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Does anyone else feel like she is mocking someone with an English accent in the chorus?" one Redditor wrote. "I feel like it’s about Tom. I can picture him writing to her. Seems in line with his personality. And 'I’m doing better' because she was not really doing well during the time that they dated," another wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another is convinced it's actually a friend, writing, "[I'm] gonna say it: k * * rlie kl ** s." Could it really be Karlie Kloss? It's true that in 2019, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Karlie had to publicly assure fans</a> that she Taylor are still friends, which felt a bit forced. This happened after Taylor's essay, <a href=# rel=nofollow>"30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30"</a> was published in Elle. In her letter, she paints a not-so-rosy picture of her iconic #squad, which included Karlie.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Taylor wrote, "In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It’s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them.”</p><p>Taylor herself hasn't revealed what "Closure" is about, which doesn't mean she won't ever talk about that and all the other Easter eggs in "Evermore." <a href=# rel=nofollow>Taylor Swift shared</a>, per Vulture, "I’ve always loved that in music you can kinda slip into different identities and you can sing from other people’s perspectives."</p><p>Could it be that "Closure" isn't even from Taylor's lived perspective? Maybe it's best to just enjoy the music versus try to decode it.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJykn6jCs7GMmpmoraRisrex0aamq50%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ara-mina-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ara Mina Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drivers-warned-emergency-alert-siren-phone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Warning for drivers as major emergency siren to be blasted through your phone in weeks</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
