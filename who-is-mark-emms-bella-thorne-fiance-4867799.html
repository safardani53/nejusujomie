He is an entrepreneur who founded his first company, Fire Global Media Productions, in 2008.

Fraud. Fugitives, a true crime story that recounts how <strong>Sarma Melngailis</strong>, a once-awarded vegan restaurateur behind the now-shuttered New York’s Pure Food & Wine, got involved with and married a conman named <strong>Shane Fox</strong> who took all of her restaurant’s funds under the promise that he would make her foodie dreams come true and make her beloved pitbull immortal. Sarma got hit with reality after getting caught while on the run after having stolen $2 million with Mark.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. It was the most bizarre and surreal story I’d ever heard and I had to try and make sense of it,” Mark recalled to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yahoo! entertainment</a> about his first impressions of the celebrity chef’s story. “How and why did this nightmare happen to someone like Sarma? It was also a story that I found deeply shocking and cruel and it felt important that it be told to a wider audience.”</p><h2>Mark Emms Gave Bella A 10-Carat Engagement Ring</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>As seen above, Mark proposed to Bella with a stunning 10-carat emerald-cut ring, which she proudly showed off for all to see.
