The comedian made jokes at the desk about spending time with anti-vax relatives and having a family member who supports former President&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Donald Trump</a>.&nbsp;</strong>“You shouldn’t cut anti-vax people out of your life. They could be dead tomorrow. Spend time with them, call them, get in the will,” he quipped.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>After&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Colin Jost</a>&nbsp;</strong>mentioned Trump-supporting family members, Michael had a hilarious joke about confronting his dad. “When I found out my dad was voting for Trump, I sat him down, and I told him, ‘Hey, if you keep going down this path, I might have to pay for my own car insurance next year,'” he joked.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Big changes are coming to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Saturday Night Live</a>&nbsp;for its <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>48th season</a>.
