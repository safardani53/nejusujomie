The 21-year-old, star athlete will be the first player selected when the NFL Draft begins on April 27 in Philadelphia. Get to know him, below!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. Garrett is a Texas native, who made a splash in his hometown of Arlington.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>He was a letterman in football, basketball and track at Martin High School. In football, Garrett was labeled a 5-star recruit, and eventually committed to&nbsp;Texas A&M University in 2013. He arrived&nbsp;at&nbsp;A&M as the no. 2 overall prospect in the nation, and he was a star defensive end for the team. As a freshman, he actually broke multiple Aggies’ sack records in less than 10 games.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The 6’5″, 261 pound player has a reputation of being ferocious on the field. His sacks have been said to be earth-shattering, and he’s a fearless pass rusher.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>2. Garrett was a star at the NFL Combine, ahead of the draft.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>He dominated the combine when he ran a 4.64 40-yard dash on the field of Lucas Oil Stadium. His numbers&nbsp;tied him for the fifth fastest time in combine history for a defensive lineman of his size.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>To anybody willing to stand in his way…</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Beware of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@MylesLGarrett</a>.<br>👀 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#NFLDraft</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/xpZFlvrWiw</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>— NFL (@NFL) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>April 27, 2017</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>3. Garrett is expected to be picked by the Cleveland Browns during the NFL Draft.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>If all goes as planned, the Browns will have a player who will “change their team,” according to Garrett’s position coach at A&M,&nbsp;<strong>Terry Price</strong>.&nbsp;“He’s the best player in the draft… He’s that kind of guy,” Price told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cleveland.com</a>. “And he can be the face of your franchise, so I don’t think there’s any question that he should be the No. 1 overall pick.”</p><h3><a href=#>Click For Photos From The NFL</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>4. Although the hype around Garrett is strong, the doubtful whispers are quite loud…</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>While Garrett performed miraculously&nbsp;at the NFL Combine, among other events, there’s a lot of chatter that he’s not as great as people have said. One person in particular? —&nbsp;Hall of Fame defensive lineman,&nbsp;<strong>Warren Sapp</strong>, 44.&nbsp;“I don’t see it from this kid,” Sapp said on April 19 about Garrett being named the no. 1 draft pick. “I see the splash plays; everybody gets those. Where’s the game he took over? Where? Any defensive lineman who’s the No. 1 pick, you turn up and you say, ‘There it is!’ This kid, no, I don’t. I’m a pretty plain and frank guy, and I watch the tape and he disappears. I watch the tape, and he absolutely disappears.” Yikes. Many have even argued&nbsp;that Garrett’s injury history and lack of play time [due to injury] has left him&nbsp;as a shaky pick for the no. 1 spot. An ankle injury sidelined him for part of the 2016 season at A&M.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Garrett also caused quite a bit of controversy [in Feb. 2017] when a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video emerged online</a> from Dec. 2016, where he jokingly asked for the Dallas Cowboys to trade up for the top pick in the draft. He did damage control on March 4 when he apologized to the Browns for his comments that were intended to be&nbsp;a joke.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>5. Garrett comes from a family of athletes.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-17>His brother, <strong>Sean Williams</strong> [Boston College], was selected as the no. 17 pick in the first round of the 2007 NBA draft. He played in the league from 2007-2012. His older sister, <strong>Brea Garrett</strong>, is currently a senior at Texas A&M, where she is the reigning NCAA champion in track & field [weight throw].</p><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, where you think Garrett will go?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH11e5FwZrCgn2K2tHnMsqOeq12crrO%2BxK2rZqaWoXqlvsCfq2amn2J%2BbrzInKJmnp%2BkwaOty6VkrZ2olsBurcxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./woman-banishes-spiders-from-home-mint-anti-bacterial-spray.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Woman banishes spiders from her home using clever 2 tip all you need is some mint and anti-bac</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-christmas-movies-to-stream.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Christmas Movies to Stream Online in 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./candice-swanepoel-lacy-lingerie-victorias-secret.html>Candice Swanepoel wows in white lacy lingerie for sizzling Victorias Secret photoshoot The US</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./glen-casada-was-arrested-on-federal-fraud-charges.html>Glen Casada Was Arrested On Federal Fraud Charges</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-blow-the-man-down-a-true-story.html>Is 'Blow the Man Down' a True Story?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./strictly-come-dancing-pair-strip-naked-as-they-announce-new-show-that-is-set-to-challenge-itv-favourite.html>Strictly Come Dancing pair strip naked as they announce new show that is set to challenge ITV favour</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-david-nail-dating.html>Who is David Nail Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveDash.
