We will not give up,” he said.

He would bring surplus weapons to countries in Africa, South America, and the Middle East. During his time as a dealer, he would use different aliases and passports to travel seamlessly. He was given his infamous nickname “The Merchant of Death” in 2003, by UK Foreign Minister&nbsp;<strong>Peter Hain,</strong> per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BBC</a>.&nbsp;He was also the subject of a 2007 book titled after his nickname.</p><h2>He was in the Russian military and began illegally selling weapons in the 90s</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Bout has denied that he was an arms dealer, and his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>now-defunct website</a> revealed that he was a Lieutenant translator in the Soviet Union army, before he began selling weapons. It is believed that he began trading a surplus aircraft in Africa in 1993, after suggesting that he join the “active reserves,” according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Economist</a>.&nbsp;He became well-known after reportedly working with now-convicted warlord&nbsp;<strong>Charles Taylor&nbsp;</strong>in arming revolutionaries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Viktor-Bout-5-Things-Brittney-Griner-embed-2.jpg><h2>He was arrested in 2008</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>After many years of traveling the globe and selling weapons, Bout was arrested in a sting operation by the U.S. in 2008. He was lured to a conference room in a Bangkok hotel to negotiate an arms deal with two people he believed to be from the Colombian insurgent group FARC, but were DEA operatives from the U.S.&nbsp; He was arrested and tried in a Thai court and extradited to the States in 2010.</p><h2>He was found guilty in the United States in 2011</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>When Bout was sent to the U.S., he was tried for conspiring to kill Americans as well as conspiring to use and anti-aircraft missile, wire fraud, money laundering, and the illegal purchase of an aircraft. He was found guilty in 2011, and the following year, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Bout denied the crimes on his website. Prosecutors focused on his time supplying weapons to FARC, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a>. “Viktor Bout has been international arms trafficking enemy number one for many years, arming some of the most violent conflicts around the globe,” U.S. Attorney <strong>Preet Bharara&nbsp;</strong>said at the time. “He was finally brought to justice in an American court for agreeing to provide a staggering number of military-grade weapons to an avowed terrorist organization committed to killing Americans.”</p><h2>Bout has been portrayed in movies and TV shows</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Bout’s story, as well as depictions of his arrest, have popped up in various forms of media over the years. The documentary series&nbsp;Damian Lewis: Spy Wars&nbsp;and&nbsp;Manhunt: Kill or Capture&nbsp;both have episodes focusing on Bout. The&nbsp; 2005 film&nbsp;Lord of War&nbsp;was reportedly inspired by Bout. The movie starred&nbsp;<strong>Nicolas Cage&nbsp;</strong>playing an arms dealer who “confronts the morality of his work as he is being chased by an INTERPOL Agent,” according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LDqrfTqKlmmp%2BqwW6t0aaqZpyVlrmmvoxtcG5saWaBcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./noella-bergener-husband.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is RHOC Noella Bergeners husband, Sweet James Bergener?
